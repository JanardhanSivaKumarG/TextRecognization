a01-000u-s00-00 === A MOVE to stop Mr. Gaitskell from 
a01-000u-s00-01 === nominating any more Labour life Peers
a01-000u-s00-02 === is to be made at a meeting of Labour 
a01-000u-s00-03 === M Ps tomorrow . 
a01-000u-s01-00 === Mr. Michael Foot has 
a01-000u-s01-01 === put down a resolution on the subject 
a01-000u-s01-02 === and he is to be backed by Mr. Will
a01-000u-s01-03 === Griffiths , M P for Manchester Exchange . 
a01-003u-s00-00 === Though they may gather some Left-wing 
a01-003u-s00-01 === support , a large majority of Labour 
a01-003u-s00-02 === M Ps are likely to turn down the Foot-
a01-003u-s00-03 === Griffiths resolution . 
a01-003u-s01-00 === Mr. Foot's line will 
a01-003u-s01-01 === be that as Labour M Ps opposed the 
a01-003u-s01-02 === Government Bill which brought life peers 
a01-003u-s01-03 === into existence , they should not now put 
a01-003u-s01-04 === forward nominees .
a01-003u-s02-00 === He believes that the 
a01-003u-s02-01 === House of Lords should be abolished and 
a01-003u-s02-02 === that Labour should not take any steps 
a01-003u-s02-03 === which would appear to " prop up " an out-
a01-007u-s00-00 === Since 1958 , 13 Labour life Peers and
a01-007u-s00-01 === Peeresses have been created . 
a01-007u-s01-00 === Most Labour 
a01-007u-s01-01 === sentiment would still favour the abolition 
a01-007u-s01-02 === of the House of Lords , but while it remains 
a01-007u-s01-03 === Labour has to have an adequate number 
a01-007u-s01-04 === of members .
a01-007u-s02-00 === THE two rival African 
a01-007u-s02-01 === Nationalist Parties of Northern Rhodesia 
a01-007u-s02-02 === have agreed to get together to face 
a01-007u-s02-03 === the challenge from Sir Roy Welensky , 
a01-007u-s02-04 === the Federal Premier .
a01-011u-s00-00 === Delegates from Mr. Kenneth Kaunda's 
a01-011u-s00-01 === United National Independence Party 
a01-011u-s00-02 === ( 280,000 members ) and Mr. Harry Nkumbula's 
a01-011u-s00-03 === African National Congress ( 400,000 ) will 
a01-011u-s00-04 === meet in London today to discuss a common 
a01-011u-s00-05 === course of action . 
a01-011u-s01-00 === Sir Roy is violently
a01-011u-s01-01 === opposed to Africans getting an elected 
a01-011u-s01-02 === majority in Northern Rhodesia , but the 
a01-011u-s01-03 === Colonial Secretary , Mr. Iain Macleod , 
a01-011u-s01-04 === is insisting on a policy of change .
a01-014u-s00-00 === Sir Roy's United Federal Party is 
a01-014u-s00-01 === boycotting the London talks on the 
a01-014u-s00-02 === Protectorate's future . 
a01-014u-s01-00 === Said Mr. Nkumbula 
a01-014u-s01-01 === last night : 
a01-014u-s02-00 === " We want to discuss what to 
a01-014u-s02-01 === do if the British 
a01-014u-s03-00 === demonstrations . " 
a01-014u-s04-00 === Yesterday Sir Roy's chief aide , Mr. 
a01-014u-s04-01 === Julius Greenfield , telephoned his chief 
a01-014u-s04-02 === a report on his talks with Mr. Macmillan 
a01-014u-s04-03 === at Chequers .
a01-020u-s00-00 === Mr. Macleod went on with the conference 
a01-020u-s00-01 === at Lancaster House despite the crisis 
a01-020u-s00-02 === which had blown up . 
a01-020u-s01-00 === He has now revealed 
a01-020u-s01-01 === his full plans to the Africans and Liberals 
a01-020u-s01-02 === attending . 
a01-020u-s02-00 === These plans do not give the 
a01-020u-s02-01 === Africans the overall majority they are 
a01-020u-s02-02 === seeking . 
a01-020u-s03-00 === African delegates are studying 
a01-020u-s03-01 === them today . 
a01-020u-s04-00 === The conference will meet 
a01-020u-s04-01 === to discuss the function of a proposed 
a01-020u-s04-02 === House of Chiefs .
a01-026u-s00-00 === MR. IAIN MACLEOD , the Colonial Secretary , 
a01-026u-s00-01 === denied in the Commons last night that 
a01-026u-s00-02 === there have been secret negotiations on 
a01-026u-s00-03 === Northern Rhodesia's future . 
a01-026u-s01-00 === The Northern 
a01-026u-s01-01 === Rhodesia conference in London has been
a01-026u-s01-02 === boycotted by the two main settlers' parties - 
a01-026u-s01-03 === the United Federal Party and the Dominion 
a01-026u-s01-04 === Party . 
a01-026u-s02-00 === But representatives of Sir Roy 
a01-026u-s02-01 === Welensky , Prime Minister of the Central 
a01-026u-s02-02 === African Federation , went to Chequers at 
a01-026u-s02-03 === the week-end for talks with Mr. Macmillan . 
a01-030u-s00-00 === Northern Rhodesia is a member of the Federation . 
a01-030u-s01-00 === Mr. Macleod was not at the week-end 
a01-030u-s01-01 === meeting . 
a01-030u-s02-00 === But he told M Ps yesterday : 
a01-030u-s03-00 === " I 
a01-030u-s03-01 === have no knowledge of secret negotiations . " 
a01-030u-s04-00 === He said Britain had an obligation to consult 
a01-030u-s04-01 === the Federal Government . 
a01-030u-s05-00 === But the final 
a01-030u-s05-01 === decision remained with the British Government . 
a01-030u-s06-00 === Mr. James Callaghan , Labour's Colonial 
a01-030u-s06-01 === spokesman , said Sir Roy had no right to 
a01-030u-s06-02 === delay progress in the talks by refusing 
a01-030u-s06-03 === to sit round the conference table . 
a01-043u-s00-00 === Informal talks at Lancaster House will 
a01-043u-s00-01 === resume today . 
a01-043u-s01-00 === PRESIDENT KENNEDY today 
a01-043u-s01-01 === defended the appointment of a Negro as 
a01-043u-s01-02 === his Housing Minister . 
a01-043u-s02-00 === It has aroused strong 
a01-043u-s02-01 === opposition from the anti-Negro senators of the 
a01-043u-s02-02 === Deep South . 
a01-043u-s03-00 === The negro is Mr. Robert 
a01-043u-s03-01 === Weaver of New York . 
a01-043u-s04-00 === One of his tasks will 
a01-043u-s04-01 === be to see there is no racial discrimination 
a01-043u-s04-02 === in Government and State housing 
a01-043u-s04-03 === projects . 
a01-049u-s00-00 === Senator Allen Ellender of Louisiana 
a01-049u-s00-01 === sparked off the opposition by telling a 
a01-049u-s00-02 === television audience it was " current 
a01-049u-s00-03 === Washington gossip " that Weaver once had 
a01-049u-s00-04 === Communist affiliations . 
a01-049u-s01-00 === The Senate Banking 
a01-049u-s01-01 === Committee , which is headed by another 
a01-049u-s01-02 === Southern Senator - Willis Robertson , of 
a01-049u-s01-03 === Virginia - met today in closed session to 
a01-049u-s01-04 === discuss Weaver's appointment . S
a01-049u-s02-00 === enator 
a01-049u-s02-01 === Robertson later disclosed he had sent a letter 
a01-049u-s02-02 === to Mr. Kennedy saying he had received 
a01-049x-s00-00 === Senator Allen Ellender , of Louisiana , 
a01-049x-s00-01 === sparked off the opposition by telling a 
a01-049x-s00-02 === television audience it was " current Washington 
a01-049x-s00-03 === gossip " that Weaver once had Communist affilia
a01-049x-s00-04 === tions . 
a01-049x-s01-00 === The Senate Banking Committee , which 
a01-049x-s01-01 === is headed by another Southern Senator - 
a01-049x-s01-02 === Willis Robertson , of Virginia - met today in 
a01-049x-s01-03 === closed session to discuss Weaver's appointment . 
a01-049x-s02-00 === Senator Robertson later disclosed he had sent a 
a01-049x-s02-01 === letter to Mr. Kennedy saying he had received several 
a01-049x-s02-02 === complaints about Weaver's loyalty . 
a01-053u-s00-00 === He said these concerned Mr. Weaver's 
a01-053u-s00-01 === alleged association with organisations black- 
a01-053u-s00-02 === listed by the Government . 
a01-053u-s01-00 === Immediately Mr. 
a01-053u-s01-01 === Kennedy rushed a letter to Senator Robertson 
a01-053u-s01-02 === saying the Federal Bureau of In- vestigation had 
a01-053u-s01-03 === reported on Mr. Weaver . 
a01-053u-s02-00 === He believed 
a01-053u-s02-01 === he would perform " outstanding service " 
a01-053u-s02-02 === in his post . 
a01-053u-s03-00 === Senator Robertson's committee 
a01-053u-s03-01 === has to pass Mr. Weaver's nomination before it 
a01-053u-s03-02 === can be considered by the full Senate . 
a01-058u-s00-00 === PRESIDENT KENNEDY is ready to get tough 
a01-058u-s00-01 === over West Germany's cash offer to help 
a01-058u-s00-02 === America's balance of payments position . 
a01-058u-s01-00 === He 
a01-058u-s01-01 === said bluntly in Washington yester- day that 
a01-058u-s01-02 === the offer - 357million - was not good enough . 
a01-058u-s02-00 === And he indicated that his Government 
a01-058u-s02-01 === would try to get Germany to pay more . 
a01-058u-s03-00 === He 
a01-058u-s03-01 === did not mention personal talks with Dr. 
a01-058u-s03-02 === Adenauer , the West German Chancellor . 
a01-063u-s00-00 === But he said discussions " on a higher 
a01-063u-s00-01 === level than in the past " might be useful . 
a01-063u-s01-00 === The President will probably discuss the 
a01-063u-s01-01 === problem with Dr. Brentano , the West German 
a01-063u-s01-02 === Foreign Minister , who is due in Washington 
a01-063u-s01-03 === next week . 
a01-063u-s02-00 === A big slice of Germany's " aid " 
a01-063u-s02-01 === is the early payment of a 210 million 
a01-063u-s02-02 === debt to America . 
a01-063u-s03-00 === United States officials 
a01-063u-s03-01 === quickly point out that this is money due 
a01-063u-s03-02 === to America anyway . 
a01-068u-s00-00 === And they are unimpressed by the Germans' claim 
a01-068u-s00-01 === that they cannot pay more than 357 million 
a01-068u-s00-02 === without upsetting their own economy . 
a01-068u-s01-00 === The 
a01-068u-s01-01 === Americans say Germany is having it too 
a01-068u-s01-02 === good and is not paying for the past 
a01-068u-s01-03 === or for the present . 
a01-068u-s02-00 === The Adenauer Government 
a01-068u-s02-01 === flatly rejected attempts by the Eisenhower 
a01-068u-s02-02 === Government to get them to pay a regular 
a01-068u-s02-03 === sum towards the cost of keeping American 
a01-068u-s02-04 === troops in Germany . 
a01-072u-s00-00 === These support costs are a big drain on 
a01-072u-s00-01 === America's dollar reserves . 
a01-072u-s01-00 === Dr. Adenauer's 
a01-072u-s01-01 === answer is the once-and-for-all cash 
a01-072u-s01-02 === offer of 357 million . 
a01-072u-s02-00 === President Kennedy's 
a01-072u-s02-01 === rejection of it is a painful blow to the 
a01-072u-s02-02 === West German Government . 
a01-072u-s03-00 === It will now have 
a01-072u-s03-01 === to pay more - and increase taxation to do 
a01-072u-s03-02 === so - or run the obvious # risks in upsetting 
a01-072u-s03-03 === the new American administration . 
a01-077u-s00-00 === And , since this is election year in West 
a01-077u-s00-01 === Germany , Dr. Adenauer is in a tough spot . 
a01-077u-s01-00 === Joyce Egginton cables : 
a01-077u-s02-00 === President Kennedy 
a01-077u-s02-01 === at his Washington Press con- ference admitted 
a01-077u-s02-02 === he did not know whether America was 
a01-077u-s02-03 === lagging behind Russia in missile power . 
a01-077u-s03-00 === He said he was waiting for his senior 
a01-077u-s03-01 === military aides to come up with the answer 
a01-077u-s03-02 === on February 20 . 
a01-082u-s00-00 === This surprising statement was a sharp about- 
a01-082u-s00-01 === face from his warnings during the 
a01-082u-s00-02 === Presidential election campaign . 
a01-082u-s01-00 === He claimed 
a01-082u-s01-01 === slackness in the Eisenhower Administration 
a01-082u-s01-02 === had caused America to lag behind Russia 
a01-082u-s01-03 === in nuclear development . 
a01-082u-s02-00 === President Kennedy 
a01-082u-s02-01 === did his best to avoid giving Pressmen 
a01-082u-s02-02 === a direct answer . George Brown 
a01-082u-s03-00 === CHILDREN TWO men who are poles apart 
a01-082u-s03-01 === in personality last night dominated 
a01-087u-s00-00 === Mr. Brown , passionate and warm-hearted , 
a01-087u-s00-01 === led Labour's attack on the higher health 
a01-087u-s00-02 === charges . 
a01-087u-s01-00 === Mr. Powell , white-faced and 
a01-087u-s01-01 === outwardly unemotional , replied with a 
a01-087u-s01-02 === statistical state- ment - and ended by inciting 
a01-087u-s01-03 === Labour M Ps to angry uproar . 
a01-087u-s02-00 === One dealt 
a01-087u-s02-01 === with the human issue behind the Health 
a01-087u-s02-02 === Service ; the other tried to show that the 
a01-087u-s02-03 === balance-sheet must always come first . 
a01-091u-s00-00 === The result of the vote was not in doubt . 
a01-091u-s01-00 === For the Tories were massed in answer to 
a01-091u-s01-01 === their whips to defeat a censure motion 
a01-091u-s01-02 === on the Government for " undermining the 
a01-091u-s01-03 === Health Service " and placing heavy burdens 
a01-091u-s01-04 === on those least able to bear them . 
a01-091u-s02-00 === Mr. 
a01-091u-s02-01 === Brown declared that the policy under 
a01-091u-s02-02 === censure was monstrous . 
a01-091u-s03-00 === It had offended 
a01-091u-s03-01 === many people far beyond the ranks of 
a01-091u-s03-02 === Labour supporters . 
a01-096u-s00-00 === The Press , many doctors and public were 
a01-096u-s00-01 === denouncing the proposals . 
a01-096u-s01-00 === He quoted from 
a01-096u-s01-01 === this letter which Mr. Gaitskell had received : 
a01-096u-s02-00 === " My background is a doctor of 68 , who 
a01-096u-s02-01 === has practised medicine for 43 years , chiefly 
a01-096u-s02-02 === as a panel doctor . 
a01-096u-s03-00 === " I am a lifelong 
a01-096u-s03-01 === Conservative . 
a01-096u-s04-00 === I am horrified and amazed 
a01-096u-s04-01 === by my party's proposal to prostitute the 
a01-096u-s04-02 === whole principle of the State service and 
a01-096u-s04-03 === to render that service a hardship to poor 
a01-096u-s04-04 === people . 
a01-102u-s00-00 === " After a lifetime of helping others and 
a01-102u-s00-01 === healing the sick , my considered opinion is that 
a01-102u-s00-02 === anybody supporting the increased charges is a 
a01-102u-s00-03 === wicked , old - . 
a01-102u-s01-00 === " Mr. Brown went on : 
a01-102u-s02-00 === " We 
a01-102u-s02-01 === are dealing with a noble edifice which 
a01-102u-s02-02 === needs an imaginative architect to improve 
a01-102u-s02-03 === it , but it has got a quantity surveyor . 
a01-102u-s03-00 === We 
a01-102u-s03-01 === have descended from the real problems to 
a01-102u-s03-02 === fiddling about with bills of cost . 
a01-107u-s00-00 === We believe that a comprehensive medical 
a01-107u-s00-01 === service , free to the patient at the point 
a01-107u-s00-02 === of need and with one standard for all 
a01-107u-s00-03 === sick people , is good and attainable . 
a01-107u-s01-00 === " We remain for it . 
a01-107u-s02-00 === But the Tories 
a01-107u-s02-01 === never were . " 
a01-107u-s03-00 === Interrupted by angry Tories , 
a01-107u-s03-01 === Mr. Brown retorted : 
a01-107u-s04-00 === " The jackals bay 
a01-107u-s04-01 === when there is nothing better they can do . " 
a01-113u-s00-00 === He told them that their conception of social 
a01-113u-s00-01 === services was wholly different - fundamentally 
a01-113u-s00-02 === different from that of Labour . 
a01-113u-s01-00 === They would 
a01-113u-s01-01 === provide an ambulance service for the absolutely 
a01-113u-s01-02 === wretched - but it would not be too comfortable 
a01-113u-s01-03 === nor too easy to get . 
a01-113u-s02-00 === Answering jeers that 
a01-113u-s02-01 === it was Labour which first put a ceiling 
a01-113u-s02-02 === on health spending and started charges , Mr. 
a01-113u-s02-03 === Brown reminded the hostile Government benches 
a01-113u-s02-04 === that was done in 1950 because of the financial 
a01-113u-s02-05 === strain of the Korean war . 
a01-117u-s00-00 === In fact , the Tories made it worse now 
a01-117u-s00-01 === for the sick and needy than Labour had 
a01-117u-s00-02 === to make it in 1950 . 
a01-117u-s01-00 === And as a percentage 
a01-117u-s01-01 === of social service expenditure , health had 
a01-117u-s01-02 === fallen from 28.5 to 23.1 per cent. 
a01-117u-s02-00 === Then 
a01-117u-s02-01 === Mr. Brown swung his attack directly to 
a01-117u-s02-02 === the unsmiling Mr. Powell.
a01-117u-s03-00 === He demanded 
a01-117u-s03-01 === that instead of taking it out of the 
a01-117u-s03-02 === patients Mr. Powell should take ruthless 
a01-117u-s03-03 === action against the drug making industry , #
a01-117u-s03-04 === whose profits had risen by up to 400 per 
a01-122u-s00-00 === " Mr. Powell finds it easier to take it out 
a01-122u-s00-01 === of mothers , children and sick people than 
a01-122u-s00-02 === to take on this vast industry , " Mr. 
a01-122u-s00-03 === Brown commented icily . 
a01-122u-s01-00 === " Let us have a 
a01-122u-s01-01 === full inquiry into the cost of drugs and 
a01-122u-s01-02 === the pharmaceutical industry . " 
a01-122u-s02-00 === The health 
a01-122u-s02-01 === of children today owed much to the welfare 
a01-122u-s02-02 === food scheme . 
a01-122u-s03-00 === It was maintained during 
a01-122u-s03-01 === the war . 
a01-122u-s04-00 === Now in conditions of Tory 
a01-122u-s04-01 === affluence it seemed it could not be 
a01-122u-s04-02 === carried on . 
a01-128u-s00-00 === When Mr. Brown sat down Labour M Ps 
a01-128u-s00-01 === cheered for a full minute - and even his 
a01-128u-s00-02 === bitterest opponents on defence joined in . 
a01-128u-s01-00 === Mr. Powell devoted half his speech to giving 
a01-128u-s01-01 === details of plans for improving the hospital 
a01-128u-s01-02 === service , on which indeed the Government is 
a01-128u-s01-03 === making progress . 
a01-128u-s02-00 === His basic defence of the 
a01-128u-s02-01 === Health Service cuts was that " even after 
a01-128u-s02-02 === the proposed changes the net cost of the 
a01-128u-s02-03 === service to the Exchequer will have increased 
a01-128u-s02-04 === over three years by 20 per cent. 
a01-132u-s00-00 === " That cannot continue without either development 
a01-132u-s00-01 === being limited or an adjustment being made 
a01-132u-s00-02 === in financing . " 
a01-132u-s01-00 === The Government decided to 
a01-132u-s01-01 === adjust the financing - which Mr. Powell 
a01-132u-s01-02 === claimed was underpinning - not undermining - 
a01-132u-s01-03 === the service . 
a01-132u-s02-00 === Answering the attack on 
a01-132u-s02-01 === " economic charges " for welfare foods , Mr. 
a01-132u-s02-02 === Powell said that all these foods would 
a01-132u-s02-03 === still be free in families receiving regular 
a01-132u-s02-04 === National Assistance grants . 
a01-132x-s00-00 === " That cannot continue without either development 
a01-132x-s00-01 === being limited or an adjustment being made 
a01-132x-s00-02 === in financing . " 
a01-132x-s01-00 === The Government decided to adjust 
a01-132x-s01-01 === the financing - which Mr. Powell claimed was 
a01-132x-s01-02 === underpinning - not undermining - the service . 
a01-132x-s02-00 === Answering the attack on " economic charges " 
a01-132x-s02-01 === for welfare foods , Mr. Powell said that all these 
a01-132x-s02-02 === foods would still be free in families receiving 
a01-132x-s02-03 === regular National Assistance grants . 
a02-017-s00-00 === Other leading members are : Sir Henry Lintott from 
a02-017-s00-01 === the Commonwealth Relations Office , Sir William 
a02-017-s00-02 === Corell-Barnes ( Colonial Office ) , Mr. G. R. Bell 
a02-017-s00-03 === ( Treasury ) , and Mr. G. H. Andrew ( Board of Trade ) . 
a02-017-s01-00 === They will accompany Mr. Heath next month when 
a02-017-s01-01 === he goes to Brussels , headquarters of the Common 
a02-017-s01-02 === Market Commission , or wherever the Six decide 
a02-017-s01-03 === negotiations should be held . 
a02-020-s00-00 === Some of the problems were reviewed yesterday at a 
a02-020-s00-01 === meeting in Paris between M. Couve de Murville , French 
a02-020-s00-02 === Foreign Minister , and Mr. Heath . 
a02-020-s01-00 === MR. Selwyn Lloyd - 
a02-020-s01-01 === a man with troubles enough back home - seems 
a02-020-s01-02 === fated to fly into trouble abroad . 
a02-020-s02-00 === Last year it was 
a02-020-s02-01 === the riots in Istanbul , which enlivened the NATO 
a02-020-s02-02 === Council meeting . 
a02-024-s00-00 === Now we have the strikes and demonstrations in 
a02-024-s00-01 === Ghana coinciding with the meeting of the Com- 
a02-024-s00-02 === monwealth Economic Consultative Council - the 
a02-024-s00-03 === first to be held in Africa . 
a02-024-s01-00 === Only a few hours af- 
a02-024-s01-01 === ter Mr Lloyd and his 24-strong delegation landed 
a02-024-s01-02 === at Accra this morning , hundreds of shop assistants 
a02-024-s01-03 === demonstrated outside the British-owned Kingsway 
a02-024-s01-04 === Stores , the largest in town . 
a02-027-s00-00 === The stores had been hit by the same strike wave 
a02-027-s00-01 === that has paralysed the port of Takoradi for the past 
a02-027-s00-02 === week . 
a02-027-s01-00 === Root of the discontent : The austerity Budget , 
a02-027-s01-01 === including a compulsory savings scheme which the 
a02-027-s01-02 === Ghana Government introduced in July . 
a02-027-s02-00 === Ghana's strong 
a02-027-s02-01 === man is not here to face the storm . 
a02-027-s03-00 === President Nkrumah , 
a02-027-s03-01 === having made his contribution to the neutrals' conference 
a02-027-s03-02 === in Belgrade , has resumed his holiday on the Black 
a02-027-s03-03 === Sea and no one here professes to know when he 
a02-027-s03-04 === will return . 
a02-032-s00-00 === But in his absence his chief lieutenants have 
a02-032-s00-01 === not let him down . 
a02-032-s01-00 === The strong arm of authority has 
a02-032-s01-01 === been raised against the strikers and is now beginning 
a02-032-s01-02 === to tell . 
a02-032-s02-00 === Today's Ghanaian Times ( motto : " The welfare 
a02-032-s02-01 === of the people is the supreme law " ) reports : 
a02-032-s03-00 === " The 
a02-032-s03-01 === Government has been urged to take immediate ac- 
a02-032-s03-02 === tion to deal ruthlessly with the strikers . " 
a02-037-s00-00 === The urge came from a conference of activists of 
a02-037-s00-01 === Nkrumah's Convention Party " after powerful addresses 
a02-037-s00-02 === by Comrades Krobo Edusei , Tawia Adamafio , " and 
a02-037-s00-03 === others . 
a02-037-s01-00 === Strong deeds followed strong words . 
a02-037-s02-00 === In Takoradi 
a02-037-s02-01 === a " limited state of emergency " was declared , giving 
a02-037-s02-02 === the Government adequate power to maintain all 
a02-037-s02-03 === essential services and ensure food supplies . 
a02-037-s03-00 === Thus it 
a02-037-s03-01 === becomes an offence punishable with imprisonment 
a02-037-s03-02 === for anyone who " publishes a report likely to cause 
a02-037-s03-03 === alarm or prejudicial to public safety . " 
a02-042-s00-00 === And up to ten years' imprisonment can be imposed 
a02-042-s00-01 === on anyone convicted of sabotage . 
a02-042-s01-00 === These stern measures 
a02-042-s01-01 === had the desired effect today at Kumasi where the 
a02-042-s01-02 === strikers gave in , but in Takoradi , the chief storm centre , 
a02-042-s01-03 === they still holding out despite the presence of 1,400 
a02-042-s01-04 === police and 16 armoured cars . 
a02-042-s02-00 === And how did the 
a02-042-s02-01 === Government react when the strikers demonstrated in 
a02-042-s02-02 === Accra ? 
a02-090-s00-00 === " It is true he made a point of again being absent 
a02-090-s00-01 === from Northern Rhodesia when his followers have 
a02-090-s00-02 === indulged in such violence . " 
a02-090-s01-00 === But Sir Roy pointed out 
a02-090-s01-01 === that a few months ago Mr. Kaunda said that #
a02-090-s01-02 === if UNIP did not get its way what would happen 
a02-090-s01-03 === would make the Mau Mau in Kenya " seem like a 
a02-090-s01-04 === child's picnic . " 
a02-093-s00-00 === JOHN DICKIE writes : 
a02-093-s01-00 === Mr. Macmillan gave top 
a02-093-s01-01 === priority to the clash over Northern Rhodesia on his 
a02-093-s01-02 === return from Scotland yesterday . 
a02-093-s02-00 === He summoned Mr. 
a02-093-s02-01 === Iain Macleod , Colonial Secretary , and Mr. Duncan Sandys , 
a02-093-s02-02 === Commonwealth Relations Secretary for an hour's talks 
a02-093-s02-03 === at Admiralty House . 
a02-093-s03-00 === A statement is expected today 
a02-093-s03-01 === to hold the door open for modifications to the 
a02-093-s03-02 === new Constitution provided law and order is maintained 
a02-093-s03-03 === in Northern Rhodesia . 
a02-098-s00-00 === Its terms have set the Prime Minister an exacting 
a02-098-s00-01 === problem . 
a02-098-s01-00 === Mr. Sandys has warned of the risk of a 
a02-098-s01-01 === strong reaction from Sir Roy Welensky to any 
a02-098-s01-02 === suggestion that there may be fresh concessions to the 
a02-098-s01-03 === African nationalists . M
a02-098-s02-00 === r. Macleod has ample evidence 
a02-098-s02-01 === from talks with Sir John Moffat , Northern Rhodesian 
a02-098-s02-02 === Liberal leader , and Mr. Kaunda , that the bulk 
a02-098-s02-03 === of moderates and Africans will reject the 
a02-098-s02-04 === Constitution unless it is modified . 
a02-102-s00-00 === A ROYAL welcome for the Kabaka of 
a02-102-s00-01 === Buganda ( King Freddie ) from Princess 
a02-102-s00-02 === Elizabeth Bagaya of Toro , kneeling at the 
a02-102-s00-03 === foot of his airliner's steps at London Airport 
a02-102-s00-04 === yesterday . 
a02-102-s01-00 === Forty other Africans greeted him , 
a02-102-s01-01 === kneeling with heads bowed . 
a02-102-s02-00 === The princess , 
a02-102-s02-01 === aged 24 , is now studying history at Cambri- 
a02-102-s02-02 === dge , where she is a friend of Prince William 
a02-102-s02-03 === of Gloucester . 
a02-106-s00-00 === King Freddie and three other hereditary rulers of 
a02-106-s00-01 === native kingdoms in Uganda arrived for talks with 
a02-106-s00-02 === Colonial Secretary Mr. Iain Macleod , before the 
a02-106-s00-03 === Uganda Constitutional conference opens next Monday . 
a02-106-s01-00 === The question : Their status in an independent Uganda . 
a02-106-s02-00 === The thorniest problem for next week's conference is 
a02-106-s02-01 === to settle the relationships between them and the 
a02-106-s02-02 === rest of the country . 
a02-106-s03-00 === A Government report has 
a02-106-s03-01 === recognised their rights and recommended a form of 
a02-106-s03-02 === federal association , but the four kings are not 
a02-111-s00-00 === Instead , the kings will remain in London 
a02-111-s00-01 === and wait to hear the conference's proposals . 
a02-111-s02-00 === MR. BUTLER , the Home Secretary , has decided 
a02-111-s02-01 === to meet head-on the biggest challenge to 
a02-111-s02-02 === Government authority yet presented by the 
a02-111-s02-03 === " Ban-the-Bomb " demonstrators . 
a02-111-s03-00 === Police leave 
a02-111-s03-01 === has been cancelled and secret plans prepared 
a02-111-s03-02 === to deal with the mass sit-down rally planned 
a02-111-s03-03 === for Sunday in Parliament-square by the 
a02-111-s03-04 === Committee of 100 , the anti-nuclear arms 
a02-111-s03-05 === group . 
a02-124-s00-00 === Measures agreed so far include : 1 . A mass 
a02-124-s00-01 === call-out of police , special constables 
a02-124-s00-02 === and reserves , with 750 policemen posted 
a02-124-s00-03 === from outlying districts to stations in 
a02-124-s00-04 === the area - West End Central , Bow-street , 
a02-124-s00-05 === and Cannon-row . 
a03-047-s00-00 === It is difficult for many to see Mr. Pearson 
a03-047-s00-01 === in the role of a popular orator at the 
a03-047-s00-02 === hustings , the spellbinder that Mr. Diefen- 
a03-047-s00-03 === baker was in the last two campaigns . 
a03-047-s01-00 === The 
a03-047-s01-01 === impression remains that the Liberal leader 
a03-047-s01-02 === is still the diplomatist , more at home 
a03-047-s01-03 === in the chancery , or the corridors of the United 
a03-047-s01-04 === Nations , not the father figure , so necessary 
a03-047-s01-05 === in Canadian leadership , or the practical 
a03-047-s01-06 === politician , able to talk about sewage problems 
a03-047-s01-07 === in Algoma East . 
a03-050-s00-00 === On the other hand , Mr. Pearson excels 
a03-050-s00-01 === in meeting people informally , but many 
a03-050-s00-02 === still regard him " as some sort of cross 
a03-050-s00-03 === between an egghead and a missionary " . 
a03-050-s01-00 === His party advisers are now trying to 
a03-050-s01-01 === correct that image . 
a03-050-s02-00 === The bow tie has 
a03-050-s02-01 === gone ; he is having lessons on 
a03-050-s02-02 === television techniques and is being coached 
a03-050-s02-03 === by speech experts . 
a03-071-s00-00 === But , at the same time , there is reason to 
a03-071-s00-01 === believe that the Federal Government is not 
a03-071-s00-02 === convinced , on the basis of the information 
a03-071-s00-03 === it has so far , that such a project would 
a03-071-s00-04 === be justified from a scientific point of view ; 
a03-071-s00-05 === and not merely constitute a " prestige " 
a03-071-s00-06 === satellite , duplicating to some extent American 
a03-071-s00-07 === efforts , as Die Welt suggests today in 
a03-071-s00-08 === a highly critical editorial article . 
a03-073-s00-00 === On the specific question of the use of Blue 
a03-073-s00-01 === Streak , Mr. Thorneycroft's task will be 
a03-073-s00-02 === easier . 
a03-073-s01-00 === He can point out that this is the 
a03-073-s01-01 === only rocket and launcher in Europe to 
a03-073-s01-02 === have reached a sufficient stage of development 
a03-073-s01-03 === for adaptation as the first stage in 
a03-073-s01-04 === putting a heavy satellite into outer space . 
a03-073-s02-00 === There has also been some talk of adopting another 
a03-073-s02-01 === British rocket , Black Knight , for the second 
a03-073-s02-02 === stage , but the French have one of their 
a03-073-s02-03 === own called Veronique which they would 
a03-073-s02-04 === like to see used . 
a03-080-s00-00 === The Foreign Ministry spokesman added 
a03-080-s00-01 === today , however , that the Brussels Treaty 
a03-080-s00-02 === was irrelevant , because research on the 
a03-080-s00-03 === various rocket stages had already been 
a03-080-s00-04 === concluded , and only cooperation on the type 
a03-080-s00-05 === of capsule was involved . 
a03-080-s01-00 === A lesser obstacle 
a03-080-s01-01 === to German participation is the absence of 
a03-080-s01-02 === any Ministry or Minister directly responsible 
a03-080-s01-03 === for it - and therefore of any budget 
a03-080-s01-04 === under which funds could be appropriated . 
a03-089-s00-00 === This is expected eventually to replace the 
a03-089-s00-01 === Fiat G-91 , and the F 104 Starfighter , 
a03-089-s00-02 === the backbone of the German Air 
a03-089-s00-03 === Force . 
a05-000-s00-00 === THE next White Paper on defence , to 
a05-000-s00-01 === be published in March , is likely to 
a05-000-s00-02 === contain a five-year plan for the three 
a05-000-s00-03 === Services . 
a05-000-s01-00 === Its aim will be to produce superbly 
a05-000-s01-01 === equipped , all-Regular forces of 
a05-000-s01-02 === about 400,000 men . 
a05-000-s02-00 === The three Services 
a05-000-s02-01 === would be " integrated " to a greater 
a05-000-s02-02 === extent than ever before . 
a05-013-s00-00 === The scheme will be subject to Cabinet 
a05-013-s00-01 === approval . 
a05-013-s01-00 === Mr. Watkinson remains con- 
a05-013-s01-01 === vinced that the policy initiated in 
a05-013-s01-02 === 1957 , in Mr. Sandys's time as Minister 
a05-013-s01-03 === of Defence , is still correct . 
a05-013-s02-00 === This was to 
a05-013-s02-01 === return to the tradition of all-Regular 
a05-013-s02-02 === voluntary forces , with the last National 
a05-013-s02-03 === Serviceman out of uniform by the end 
a05-013-s02-04 === of 1962 . 
a05-017-s00-00 === The Minister regards the recent trend 
a05-017-s00-01 === of recruiting figures as encouraging . 
a05-017-s01-00 === He is confident the aim can be achieved . 
a05-017-s02-00 === While the possibility of an eventual return 
a05-017-s02-01 === to National Service in some form 
a05-017-s02-02 === cannot be entirely discounted , he does 
a05-017-s02-03 === not agree that the point has been reached 
a05-017-s02-04 === where this need even be considered . 
a05-017-s03-00 === If 
a05-017-s03-01 === National Service is ever resorted to , 
a05-017-s03-02 === engagement would probably have to be for 
a05-017-s03-03 === three years . 
a05-022-s00-00 === It is thought this would be the minimum 
a05-022-s00-01 === necessary for the extended training modern 
a05-022-s00-02 === arms require and to enable each man to 
a05-022-s00-03 === serve at least a year overseas . 
a05-022-s01-00 === There is 
a05-022-s01-01 === no truth in suggestions that Mr. Watkinson 
a05-022-s01-02 === is at odds with the Service chiefs over 
a05-022-s01-03 === the decision to dispense with National 
a05-022-s01-04 === Service , or over any other aspect of 
a05-022-s01-05 === defence policy . 
a05-025-s00-00 === Criticisms about Army manpower appear 
a05-025-s00-01 === to have come mainly from retired officers 
a05-025-s00-02 === who have held high positions but 
a05-025-s00-03 === are out of touch with the existing situation . 
a05-025-s01-00 === Mr. Watkinson has had the utmost support 
a05-025-s01-01 === from the C.I.G.S. , Field-Marshal Sir 
a05-025-s01-02 === Francis Festing , who believes completely 
a05-025-s01-03 === in the principle of an all-Regular army . 
a05-025-s02-00 === Gen. Sir Richard Hull , who is to succeed 
a05-025-s02-01 === Sir Francis , is equally convinced Mr. 
a05-025-s02-02 === Watkinson is right . 
a05-029-s00-00 === Sir Francis is to hand over to Sir Richard 
a05-029-s00-01 === as from Nov. 1 . 
a05-029-s01-00 === The hand-over , due in 
a05-029-s01-01 === September , was delayed because of the 
a05-029-s01-02 === Berlin crisis . 
a05-029-s02-00 === Mr. Watkinson and his advisers 
a05-029-s02-01 === felt the change would be unwise at a 
a05-029-s02-02 === moment # when attention had to be 
a05-029-s02-03 === concentrated on possible need for important 
a05-029-s02-04 === military operations . 
a05-029-s03-00 === For this reason Sir 
a05-029-s03-01 === Francis stayed on , and # sacrificed 
a05-029-s03-02 === his leave . 
a05-039-s00-00 === There was a computed 8.4 per cent. swing 
a05-039-s00-01 === towards the Nationalist party of Dr. Verwoerd , 
a05-039-s00-02 === the Prime Minister . 
a05-039-s01-00 === This implies the dis- 
a05-039-s01-01 === appearance of the Progressive party from 
a05-039-s01-02 === the House . 
a05-039-s02-00 === Early results in yesterday's 
a05-039-s02-01 === general election showed Nationalists being 
a05-039-s02-02 === returned in their strongholds , like Bloem- 
a05-039-s02-03 === fontein and the Transvaal , with slightly 
a05-039-s02-04 === increased majorities . 
a05-039-s03-00 === In the Cape , the 
a05-039-s03-01 === veteran United Party politician , Mr. Harry 
a05-039-s03-02 === Lawrence , standing as a Progressive , was 
a05-044-s00-00 === The defeat of the leader of the 
a05-044-s00-02 === Elizabeth South , announced immediately 
a05-044-s00-03 === afterwards by the United party candidate , 
a05-044-s00-04 === Mr. Plewman , left the Progressives deprived 
a05-044-s00-05 === of both their chief figures . 
a05-044-s01-00 === Dr. Verwoerd and 
a05-044-s01-01 === the Leader of the Opposition , Sir de 
a05-044-s01-02 === Villiers Graaff , have been returned unopposed . 
a05-044-s02-00 === The contests were for 86 seats as 70 
a05-044-s02-01 === Nationalists and 20 United party candi- 
a05-044-s02-02 === dates are unopposed . 
a05-048-s00-00 === Long before polling closed at 8 p.m. it was 
a05-048-s00-01 === evident that voters were bored by the 
a05-048-s00-02 === Government's frequent appeals to the electorate . 
a05-048-s01-00 === The election was the fourth in four years . 
a05-048-s02-00 === In most constituencies it may go down as 
a05-048-s02-01 === the most apathetic in the country's history . 
a05-048-s03-00 === THE Prime Minister disclosed in the Commons 
a05-048-s03-01 === last night that he had considered early 
a05-048-s03-02 === in the Parliamentary recess whether to 
a05-048-s03-03 === mobilise reserves necessary to bring the 
a05-048-s03-04 === British Army of the Rhine on to a war footing . 
a05-053-s00-00 === He decided that it would be a great error 
a05-053-s00-01 === to do so and to recall Parliament . 
a05-053-s01-00 === But 
a05-053-s01-01 === there would be no hesitation in mobilising 
a05-053-s01-02 === if a further deterioration in the situation 
a05-053-s01-03 === warranted such a step . 
a05-053-s02-00 === It would have to be 
a05-053-s02-01 === accompanied by other measures of a military , 
a05-053-s02-02 === economic and political kind . 
a05-053-s03-00 === Mr. Macmillan , 
a05-053-s03-01 === who was winding up the foreign affairs 
a05-053-s03-02 === debate , said the Government could not 
a05-053-s03-03 === be party to accepting as a matter of 
a05-053-s03-04 === principle the imposed division of Germany . 
a05-058-s00-00 === " We must not be rattled into surrender , 
a05-058-s00-01 === but we must not - and I am not - be 
a05-058-s00-02 === afraid of negotiation . " 
a05-058-s01-00 === Mr. Godber , 
a05-058-s01-01 === Minister of State , Foreign Office , said 
a05-058-s01-02 === earlier that the Government had asked 
a05-058-s01-03 === the Medical Research Council to reassess 
a05-058-s01-04 === the fall-out position in view of the Russian 
a05-058-s01-05 === tests . 
a05-058-s02-00 === The Council's findings would be 
a05-058-s02-01 === made public . 
a05-062-s00-00 === With a vigour and authority which delighted 
a05-062-s00-01 === old Parliamentary friends and foes alike , 
a05-062-s00-02 === the Earl of Avon , the former Sir Anthony 
a05-062-s00-03 === Eden , in his maiden speech in the House 
a05-062-s00-04 === of Lords last night , gave a warning 
a05-062-s00-05 === that # appeasement over Berlin could 
a05-062-s00-06 === only lead to war . 
a05-062-s01-00 === To stand firm , he 
a05-062-s01-01 === declared , was not to invite war , but 
a05-062-s01-02 === the surest way to avert it . 
a05-069-s00-00 === It was the end of a rather curious 
a05-069-s00-01 === speech in which Mr. Macmillan wound up 
a05-069-s00-02 === the two-day debate on foreign affairs . 
a05-069-s01-00 === He began in a low , almost chatty mono- 
a05-069-s01-01 === tone , and his voice never rose to any 
a05-069-s01-02 === accent of urgency . 
a05-069-s02-00 === He passed in rapid 
a05-069-s02-01 === review the United Nations Secretariat ; 
a05-069-s02-02 === nuclear tests ; the canard about British 
a05-069-s02-03 === interference with the United Nations 
a05-069-s02-04 === in the Congo ; Kuwait ; and South-East 
a05-069-s02-05 === Asia . 
a05-073-s00-00 === He spent most of his short half-hour on 
a05-073-s00-01 === Berlin . 
a05-073-s01-00 === He deplored the possibility of 
a05-073-s01-01 === some " new myth " about betrayal of Germany 
a05-073-s01-02 === by the Allies . 
a05-073-s02-00 === " We do not , " he said , " really 
a05-073-s02-01 === know what the Russians want . " 
a05-073-s03-00 === But he was 
a05-073-s03-01 === certain that they wanted to establish a 
a05-073-s03-02 === final and irrevocable division of Germany . 
a05-073-s04-00 === Britain could not be a party to an imposed 
a05-073-s04-01 === division . 
a05-073-s05-00 === But negotiation , as the debate had 
a05-073-s05-01 === shown , could be undertaken on a variety 
a05-073-s05-02 === of bases 
a05-080-s00-00 === Mr. Macmillan explained that he had deliber- 
a05-080-s00-01 === ately refrained during the summer from 
a05-080-s00-02 === recalling Parliament or ordering mobilisation 
a05-080-s00-03 === by proclamation , such as would be 
a05-080-s00-04 === necessary to bring the British Army of the Rhine 
a05-080-s00-05 === on to a fully active footing . 
a05-080-s01-00 === That 
a05-080-s01-01 === would have created a thoroughly unde- 
a05-080-s01-02 === sirable atmosphere of panic . 
a05-080-s02-00 === He thought 
a05-080-s02-01 === that the situation was rather more 
a05-080-s02-02 === hopeful . 
a05-084-s00-00 === The Russians now realised its seriousness . 
a05-084-s01-00 === The 
a05-084-s01-01 === French doubts were more about procedure 
a05-084-s01-02 === than about substance . 
a05-084-s02-00 === The Prime Minister's 
a05-084-s02-01 === attitude of studied calm brought down the 
a05-084-s02-02 === temperature of the debate , which never 
a05-084-s02-03 === at any time rose to fever pitch , to a 
a05-084-s02-04 === remarkable degree of sub-normality . 
a05-084-s03-00 === Throughout Mr. Macmillan's speech the Earl 
a05-084-s03-01 === of Home , Foreign Secretary , was listening 
a05-084-s03-02 === in the Peers' Gallery . 
a05-089-s00-00 === The early speakers in the debate each 
a05-089-s00-01 === severely rated the speech of his predecessor . 
a05-089-s01-00 === These strictures were all too well justified . 
a05-089-s02-00 === We started with the plaintive wailings 
a05-089-s02-01 === of Mr. Healey , " Shadow " Foreign Secretary , 
a05-089-s02-02 === described by Mr. Godber , Minister of 
a05-089-s02-03 === State , Foreign Office , as " pedantic and 
a05-089-s02-04 === obscure on Berlin , damaging and obscure 
a05-089-s02-05 === on the Congo . " 
a05-089-s03-00 === In turn , Mr. Godber was 
a05-089-s03-01 === censured by Mr. Shinwell , former Labour 
a05-089-s03-02 === Defence Minister , for having read the 
a05-094-s00-00 === The trouble about such debates is that 
a05-094-s00-01 === they range too widely . 
a05-094-s01-00 === They remind one of 
a05-094-s01-01 === the Rugby match in " Tom Brown's Schooldays , " 
a05-094-s01-02 === in which all the boys were welcome to 
a05-094-s01-03 === take part , and only those who " really meant 
a05-094-s01-04 === business " removed their jackets . 
a05-094-s02-00 === Not many 
a05-094-s02-01 === metaphorical braces were visible in the 
a05-094-s02-02 === early stages of to-night's debate . 
a05-094-s03-00 === Mr. 
a05-094-s03-01 === Healey had another tilt at the Prime Minister's 
a05-094-s03-02 === golf-course Press conference , which he 
a05-094-s03-03 === described as " a display of flabby and 
a05-099-s00-00 === A reference to the reunification of Germany 
a05-099-s00-01 === brought a bark of " Start another war ! " 
a05-099-s00-02 === from Mr. Ellis Smith ( Lab. , Stoke on Trent S. ) . 
a05-099-s01-00 === Then Mr. Healey launched out on his pet 
a05-099-s01-01 === theme of limitation of armaments in Europe . 
a05-099-s02-00 === This could , he suggested , be linked with 
a05-099-s02-01 === prohibition of the production of atomic 
a05-099-s02-02 === weapons in any part of Europe . 
a05-099-s03-00 === Inspection 
a05-099-s03-01 === and control would be much easier to 
a05-099-s03-02 === establish in these territories 
a05-104-s00-00 === Mr. Healey denounced the Government for 
a05-104-s00-01 === using double standards . 
a05-104-s01-00 === Ministers had 
a05-104-s01-01 === rebuked the unaligned nations for not 
a05-104-s01-02 === condemning the new Russian tests , but 
a05-104-s01-03 === they themselves had no condemnation for 
a05-104-s01-04 === events in Angola or Algeria . 
a05-104-s02-00 === It was not for 
a05-104-s02-01 === the Government , said Mr. Healey , to 
a05-104-s02-02 === take up moral attitudes , " especially when 
a05-104-s02-03 === the temple of their religion is the 
a05-104-s02-04 === bingo-parlour . " 
a05-108-s00-00 === This puzzled such students of comparative 
a05-108-s00-01 === religion as had failed to detect this cult . 
a05-108-s01-00 === But Mr. Healey had a partial and 
a05-108-s01-01 === limited success . 
a05-108-s02-00 === He rallied behind him 
a05-108-s02-01 === the Left-wing opinion so coolly snubbed last 
a05-108-s02-02 === night by his leader , Mr. Gaitskell . 
a05-108-s03-00 === Mr. 
a05-108-s03-01 === Godber's performance merited all the mild 
a05-108-s03-02 === scorn heaped on it by Mr. Shinwell . 
a05-113-s00-00 === True , he did tell the House that the 
a05-113-s00-01 === Government had asked the Medical Research 
a05-113-s00-02 === Council to reassess the fall-out position in 
a05-113-s00-03 === view of the Russian tests , and said that the 
a05-113-s00-04 === council's findings would be published . 
a05-113-s01-00 === He was not so happy in his defence of 
a05-113-s01-01 === the Government's failure to condemn 
a05-113-s01-02 === France for her nuclear tests in the 
a05-113-s01-03 === Sahara on the grounds that they were 
a05-113-s01-04 === only little ones . 
a05-116-s00-00 === This was too reminiscent of the nursemaid 
a05-116-s00-01 === and her illegitimate baby . 
a05-116-s01-00 === For the most 
a05-116-s01-01 === part , Mr. Godber muttered his way 
a05-116-s01-02 === through a cliche-ridden Foreign Office 
a05-116-s01-03 === brief . 
a05-116-s02-00 === He resembles the elephant seal , an 
a05-116-s02-01 === # otherwise endearing creature whose 
a05-116-s02-02 === articulation is limited , we are told , to a 
a05-116-s02-03 === series of heavy sighs . 
a05-116-s03-00 === Sir Lynn Ungoed- 
a05-116-s03-01 === Thomas , M.P. for Leicester N.E. , a former

a05-121-s00-01 === of them Left-wing # sympathisers . 
a05-121-s01-00 === It condemned " the pollution of the world's 
a05-121-s01-01 === atmosphere as a crime against humanity . " 
a05-121-s02-00 === A personal letter of protest against the 
a05-121-s02-01 === tests from Canon Collins , chairman 
a05-121-s02-02 === of the Campaign for Nuclear 
a05-121-s02-03 === Disarmament , addressed to Mr.

a05-121-s02-05 === Russian Embassy . 
a05-125-s00-00 === A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT writes : 
a05-125-s01-00 === Ban-the- 
a05-125-s01-01 === bomb demonstrators thronged the Central 
a05-125-s01-02 === Lobby of the House of Commons last 
a05-125-s01-03 === night and formed a queue stretching 
a05-125-s01-04 === for more than 200 yards outside 
a05-125-s01-05 === in Old Palace Yard . 
a05-125-s02-00 === About 2,000 
a05-125-s02-01 === lobbied M.P.s and harangued them 
a05-125-s02-02 === on disarmament . 
a06-124-s00-00 === The big " squeeze " means that it is going to be more 
a06-124-s00-01 === difficult to arrange a loan or overdraft . 
a06-124-s01-00 === And banks will be 
a06-124-s01-01 === stricter in recalling existing overdrafts . 
a06-124-s02-00 === This is underlined in 
a06-124-s02-01 === the Central Bank's weekly return ... ... which shows that more 
a06-124-s02-02 === than 163,000,000 of the banks' money is now frozen in the 
a06-124-s02-03 === form of special deposits with the Bank of England . 
a06-134-s00-00 === The Notes to the Big Three and a memorandum to 
a06-134-s01-00 === They 
a06-134-s01-01 === tell : 
a06-134-s02-00 === The U.S. - 
a06-134-s03-00 === It is false to say the absence of a peace 
a06-134-s03-01 === treaty with Germany causes no real danger . 
a06-134-s04-00 === West Germany , 
a06-134-s04-01 === with its militarists and revenge-seekers , is becoming a 
a06-134-s04-02 === hotbed of war danger in Europe . 
a06-134-s05-00 === Even now , aided by 
a06-134-s05-01 === the U.S. , Britain and France , it has more than enough 
a06-134-s05-02 === forces and arms to touch off a world war . 
a06-141-s00-00 === BRITAIN - 
a06-141-s01-00 === One cannot but wonder at British bases being 
a06-141-s01-01 === put at the disposal of those very militarists who razed 
a06-141-s01-02 === Coventry and barbarously bombed London and other British 
a06-141-s01-03 === cities . 
a06-141-s02-00 === FRANCE - 
a06-141-s03-00 === One can hardly conceive the French are 
a06-141-s03-01 === not alarmed ... . 
a06-141-s04-00 === Next door , in West Germany , before everyone's 
a06-141-s04-01 === eyes there has sprung up a regular army led by former Nazi 
a06-141-s04-02 === generals and officers . 
a06-147-s00-00 === With fire and sword France denies Algeria the right to self- 
a06-147-s00-01 === determination and tramples on Tunisians' right to independence . 
a06-147-s01-00 === WEST GERMANY - 
a06-147-s02-00 === Russia would like to see a clear # 
a06-147-s02-01 === realization that West Germany would not survive even a few hours 
a06-147-s02-02 === of a third world war . 
a06-147-s03-00 === The best way to rule out such a tragic 
a06-147-s03-01 === contingency would be to sign a peace treaty to remove the cancerous 
a06-147-s03-02 === growth of West Berlin's occupation status . 
a06-157-s00-00 === This figure has been surpassed only on the eve of the 
a06-157-s00-01 === East German disturbances on July 17 , 1953 . An
a06-157-s01-00 === d officials 
a06-157-s01-01 === fear it may be too much for the city's refugee camps .

b05-055-s01-00 === A couple of bumps 
b05-055-s01-01 === on a pitch have no terrors for a good batsman with a stout 
b05-055-s01-02 === heart , a firm grip on the willow and a hefty contempt for 
b05-055-s01-03 === batting averages and all the statistical blight that makes a 
b05-055-s01-04 === mighty six these days as rare as frostbite in summer . 
b05-058-s00-00 === They 'll be clapping the man who plays a straight theodolite next . 
b05-058-s01-00 === EICHMANN continues # to reveal the extraordinary divisions of the 
b05-058-s01-01 === German mind . 
b05-058-s02-00 === Not content with arguing that he was only an 
b05-058-s02-01 === efficient cog in the machine , he now claims that part of the 
b05-058-s02-02 === endless massacre that led to the death of six million Jews was 
b05-058-s02-03 === " decent , feasible and workable . " 
b05-062-s00-00 === He feels satisfaction " from the fact that my personality had been 
b05-062-s00-01 === tested and weighed and not found wanting . " 
b05-062-s01-00 === He feels like 
b05-062-s01-01 === Pontius Pilate who washed his hands before the multitude 
b05-062-s01-02 === saying : 
b05-062-s02-00 === " I am innocent of the blood of this just person . " 
b05-062-s03-00 === Like Dr. Globke , whom I interviewed the other day , Eichmann 
b05-062-s03-01 === said : 
b05-067-s00-00 === " I drew a certain solace from the fact that I did what I 
b05-067-s00-01 === could despite my low rank . " E
b05-067-s01-00 === ichmann is on dangerous ground 
b05-067-s01-01 === when he pleads that he was only a small unit on the base 
b05-067-s01-02 === of the triangle that led to Hitler , Himmler , Hess and Goering 
b05-067-s01-03 === at the apex . 
b05-067-s02-00 === In examination he betrayed an expert and 
b05-067-s02-01 === intimate knowledge of every link in the chain of command that 
b05-067-s02-02 === led to the top . 
b05-071-s00-00 === He understood the whole apparatus with an exact and 
b05-071-s00-01 === meticulous comprehension that could only have come from a man 
b05-071-s00-02 === who used the system - and used it with power and authority . 
b05-071-s01-00 === The appalling thing about the Germans is that they can kid them- 
b05-071-s01-01 === selves and feel a sense of righteousness when their hands are 
b05-071-s01-02 === red with blood . 
b06-000-s00-00 === SOME 17 years ago , in the early summer of 1934 , 
b06-000-s00-01 === the German ambassador in London was dictating 
b06-000-s00-02 === a secret report to his chief von Papen , in Berlin . 
b06-000-s01-00 === " Britain is uncomfortable in her role of champion 
b06-000-s01-01 === of German rearmament , in opposition , to France . "
b06-000-s02-00 ===  Later that year he warned that Britain knew 
b06-000-s02-01 === Germany was breaking the agreement to stop 
b06-000-s02-02 === building bombers , and added : 
b06-008-s00-00 === Yesterday West German Defence Minister , 
b06-008-s00-01 === Herr Strauss , started talks with the British 
b06-008-s00-02 === Defence Minister , Mr. Watkinson . 
b06-008-s01-00 === Their talks 
b06-008-s01-01 === are another stage in the cloak operation , 
b06-008-s01-02 === 1961 variety , by which the West German 
b06-008-s01-03 === militarists are advancing their rearmament . 
b06-008-s02-00 === Herr Strauss told the Daily Mail last October 
b06-008-s02-01 === that his policy was to make his country 
b06-008-s02-02 === the " strongest militarily in Europe and the 
b06-008-s02-03 === United States' principal Nato ally . " 
b06-012-s00-00 === His job is to build up the military apparatus which 
b06-012-s00-01 === will back West Germany's economic domination of Western 
b06-012-s00-02 === Europe through the Common Market . 
b06-012-s01-00 === He continued this week 
b06-012-s01-01 === the argument with Mr. Watkinson which he had in public at a 
b06-012-s01-02 === Nato council meeting last year over the question : do we

b06-019-s00-00 === The process has been too slow for Herr 
b06-019-s00-01 === Strauss and last month he attacked 
b06-019-s00-02 === Britain for being an obstacle for West Germany's
b06-019-s00-03 ===  plans for a " unified supply apparatus " 
b06-019-s00-04 === in Nato . 
b06-019-s01-00 === ( A supply apparatus which would 
b06-019-s01-01 === link together the various West German 
b06-019-s01-02 === " facilities . " ) 
b06-019-s02-00 === By the end of the year there 
b06-019-s02-01 === will be 11 German divisions in Nato 
b06-019-s02-02 === compared with four divisions of 
b06-019-s02-03 === British troops . 
b06-023-s00-00 === Alongside these divisions a force of over 600 
b06-023-s00-01 === Starfighters provided by the Americans is growing 
b06-023-s00-02 === up . 
b06-023-s01-00 === These " fighters " are in fact fighter bombers 
b06-023-s01-01 === which could launch an atomic attack on 
b06-023-s01-02 === Eastern Europe . 
b06-023-s02-00 === By 1963 the Germans plan to have 
b06-023-s02-01 === nine missile battalions , with 288 missiles and 
b06-023-s02-02 === 36 firing ramps , including weapons like Matador 
b06-023-s02-03 === ( range 950 miles ) , also provided by the Americans . 
b06-032-s00-00 === All this has been achieved through Nato under 
b06-032-s00-01 === American leadership . 
b06-032-s01-00 === But a big role has been 
b06-032-s01-01 === played not only by the British Government but 
b06-032-s01-02 === by Right-Wing Labour in this country . 
b06-032-s02-00 === They have 
b06-032-s02-01 === helped build up Nato and rearm Western Germany , 
b06-032-s02-02 === in pursuit of the old familiar anti-Soviet 
b06-032-s02-03 === policy which brought disaster in 1939 . 
b06-036-s00-00 === Now the argument is being used that Nato must be maintained 
b06-036-s00-01 === and Britain must stay in it to keep the Germans in 
b06-036-s00-02 === control . 
b06-036-s01-00 === Nato , far from being a means of controlling 
b06-036-s01-01 === the German militarists , is , in fact , the cover for 
b06-036-s01-02 === building up their power . 
b06-036-s02-00 === What must Britain do ? 
b06-036-s03-00 === Today , 
b06-036-s03-01 === again , she has a key role . 
b06-036-s04-00 === Let her tell men like Strauss 
b06-036-s04-01 === that he shall have no bases or " facilities , " no help in 
b06-036-s04-02 === his quest for atomic arms . 
b06-056-s00-00 === They obstructed every effort to fight for the 
b06-056-s00-01 === Scarborough decisions , while # scratching 
b06-056-s00-02 === around frantically to overturn them next 
b06-056-s00-03 === time . 
b06-056-s01-00 === Confusion of the original issue 
b06-056-s01-01 === by misrepresentation of the decisions ,
b06-056-s01-02 === the introduction of a pseudo third way

b06-056-s01-04 === a demand that the movement unite 
b06-056-s01-05 === with the Gaitskellites on their policy 
b06-056-s01-06 === and no other seems to have done the

b06-059-s00-01 === to despair . 
b06-059-s01-00 === And yet , wherever the issues were put 
b06-059-s01-01 === clearly , sections of the movement reaffirmed their 
b06-059-s01-02 === original stand . 
b06-059-s02-00 === Only where the issues were 
b06-059-s02-01 === posed so as to cause doubt and confusion 
b06-059-s02-02 === were positions lost . 
b06-059-s03-00 === It is my view that this 
b06-059-s03-01 === immediate confusion hides the fact that the 
b06-059-s03-02 === Peace movement is still advancing and that 
b06-059-s03-03 === clarification of the issues can bring a 
b06-059-s03-04 === majority to # secure the Scarborough 
b06-059-s03-05 === decisions . 
b06-064-s00-00 === Powerful units have stood firm . 
b06-064-s01-00 === In unions where the central issues 
b06-064-s01-01 === were confused , clear policy details - 
b06-064-s01-02 === as on bases - were decisively carried . 
b06-064-s02-00 === This , and the numbers of active 
b06-064-s02-01 === workers who are beginning to understand

b06-064-s02-04 === for a campaign against weak and 
b06-064-s02-05 === doubtful positions , and for a consistent 
b06-064-s02-06 === peace policy . 
b06-071-s00-00 === Ordinary working people will never 
b06-071-s00-01 === rally to defend a policy founded on 
b06-071-s00-02 === political chicanery or elect a Labour

b06-071-s00-04 === Gaitskell's stupid hope . 
b06-071-s01-00 === The tragedy is 
b06-071-s01-01 === that enormous inroads could already 
b06-071-s01-02 === have been made into Tory strength by

b06-079-s00-03 === bases , but are in favour of German bases and 
b06-079-s00-04 === troops being trained on British soil . 
b06-079-s01-00 === The new 
b06-079-s01-01 === Defence statement , while accepting that Britain can- 
b06-079-s01-02 === not remain an independent nuclear Power , now 
b06-079-s01-03 === supports the policy of depending on American 
b06-079-s01-04 === nuclear weapons and the H-bomb , placing 
b06-079-s01-05 === Britain in an even more dangerous position . 
b06-093-s00-00 === This should strengthen the campaign to 
b06-093-s00-01 === end the manufacture and use of 
b06-093-s00-02 === nuclear weapons in Britain . 
b06-093-s01-00 === Britain then

c06-000-s02-00 === Most of it . 
c06-000-s03-00 === In the front room of 
c06-000-s03-01 === a house in Anglesey-road is a congregation who 
c06-000-s03-02 === never actually got to church , but who are

c06-000-s03-04 === and a brandy bottle . 
c06-005-s00-00 === Where the 2bhoys are . 
c06-005-s01-00 === In the hallway are 
c06-005-s01-01 === the empties ; through the door hearts are

c06-005-s03-00 === Present are some 
c06-005-s03-01 === hard-core Friends of Brendan . 
c06-005-s04-00 === They listen

c06-005-s04-02 === brandy owner's solo swish on his anecdotal 
c06-005-s04-03 === roller-coaster , with occasional stops for an old 
c06-005-s04-04 === I.R.A. air or a Connemara tear-jerker . 
c06-011-s00-00 === ALSO present is a London journalist who

c06-011-s00-04 === and who is now being pluckily convivial 
c06-011-s00-05 === to fight off the frustration . 
c06-011-s01-00 === The telephone 
c06-011-s01-01 === has rung a couple of times , calls from 
c06-011-s01-02 === other chums sniffing the wind and 
c06-011-s01-03 === offering to drop by for a chat . 
c06-020-s00-00 === That 's as bloody silly as calling a Rolls-

c06-027-s02-00 === I was there , in even faster orbit , when that

c06-031-s05-00 === HE plunges 
c06-031-s05-01 === on into reminiscences of his trips . 
c06-031-s06-00 === There is 
c06-031-s06-01 === much to recall . 
c06-039-s00-00 === Among other incidents he was banned from New 
c06-039-s00-01 === York's St. Patrick's Day parade as a " disorderly 
c06-039-s00-02 === person . " 
c06-039-s01-00 === He was in a fight after telling a 
c06-039-s01-01 === Canadian , during a chat about space-flight : 
c06-039-s02-00 === " Ireland will put a shillelagh into orbit , Israel 
c06-039-s02-01 === will put a matzo ball into orbit , and Lichtenstein 
c06-039-s02-02 === will put a postage stamp into orbit before you 
c06-039-s02-03 === Canadians put up a mouse . " 
c06-043-s00-00 === And he suffered an alcoholic 
c06-043-s00-01 === seizure and was gravely ill in 
c06-043-s00-02 === hospital with a diabetic and heart 
c06-043-s00-03 === condition . 
c06-043-s01-00 === His return to Dublin was 
c06-043-s01-01 === heralded by the announcement that 
c06-043-s01-02 === he was " off the gargle - a retired 
c06-043-s01-03 === alcoholic . " 
c06-043-s02-00 === Since then he has been 
c06-043-s02-01 === heard of often in the newspapers - 
c06-043-s02-02 === three times up before the beaks for 
c06-043-s02-03 === drunk and disorderly conduct . 
c06-052-s00-00 === What happened to the new book partially tape-recorded 
c06-052-s00-01 === by his publishers in March of last year ? 
c06-052-s01-00 === Still a skeleton . 
c06-052-s02-00 === Yet 
c06-052-s02-01 === I have before me now a 12,000-word manuscript of 
c06-052-s02-02 === a book planned to be called Confessions of an Irish 
c06-052-s02-03 === Rebel which was delivered to his agents in June . 
c06-052-s03-00 === IT 
c06-052-s03-01 === begins : 
c06-052-s04-00 === " There was a party to celebrate Deirdre's

c06-076-s00-00 === I AM happy to report that I saw some- 
c06-076-s00-01 === thing this week I have never before witnessed , 
c06-076-s00-02 === either in pictures or outside - a budgerigar 
c06-076-s00-03 === playing a drunk scene , and playing it with 
c06-076-s00-04 === perfect timing and technique . 
c06-076-s01-00 === It gives one loud , 
c06-076-s01-01 === clear hiccup and falls flat on its back . 
c06-076-s02-00 === This 
c06-076-s02-01 === brilliant budge , I may add , gets no credit 
c06-076-s02-02 === in the cast list of Come September ( Odeon , 
c06-076-s02-03 === Leicester-square ) , which suggests that it 
c06-076-s02-04 === is either using a stand-in for the stunt 
c06-080-s00-00 === The performance of our talented 
c06-080-s00-01 === feathered friend is not the only 
c06-080-s00-02 === good thing ( although the one original

c06-080-s00-04 === than-average glossy comedy , Hollywood- 
c06-080-s00-05 === styled , European set . 
c06-080-s01-00 === Most of it has 
c06-080-s01-01 === been shot in and around the 
c06-080-s01-02 === sun-terrace of the Hotel Splendido ( renamed 
c06-080-s01-03 === the Dolce Vista for the picture ) in 
c06-080-s01-04 === Portofino - and if there 's a better view 
c06-083-s00-00 === It also parades Gina Lollobrigida in a selection of neglige*? 
c06-083-s00-01 === 2e-and-nightie ensembles not too well designed for sleeping in , 
c06-083-s00-02 === and Rock Hudson at the wheel of a shining silver Rolls-Royce . 
c06-083-s01-00 === Mr. Hudson is an American millionaire who spends each 
c06-083-s01-01 === September in his Italian villa and the company of Signorina 
c06-083-s01-02 === Lollobrigida . 
c06-083-s02-00 === In the holiday seasonal months before and 
c06-083-s02-01 === after this annual idyll his major-domo ( Walter Slezak 
c06-083-s02-02 === at his most nauseating ) turns the palazzo into a luxury 
c06-083-s02-03 === hotel . 
c06-087-s00-00 === # 
c06-087-s00-01 === Inevitably there comes the time when Mr. Hudson suddenly breaks 
c06-087-s00-02 === with tradition and arrives there in July , when , just as 
c06-087-s00-03 === inevitably , the place is full of American teenagers on an 
c06-087-s00-04 === escorted tour . 
c06-087-s01-00 === Result : 
c06-087-s02-00 === Mr. Hudson and lady love Lollo find 
c06-087-s02-01 === themselves playing chaperon ( Brenda de Banzie , the official 
c06-087-s02-02 === one , has broken a leg ) to the girls , who have just 
c06-087-s02-03 === been joined by a Jeep-load of boys . 
c06-100-s00-00 === So all ends as you know it will , with the 
c06-100-s00-01 === middle-aged romancers respectably wed and 
c06-100-s00-02 === Master Darin going steady with the delectable 
c06-100-s00-03 === Sandra Dee ( to whom , I believe , he is married 
c06-100-s00-04 === in real life ) . 
c06-100-s01-00 === Miss Dee , incidentally , who keeps 
c06-100-s01-01 === turning up as the typical teenager in all the 
c06-100-s01-02 === " good girl " parts ( Tuesday Weld gets the " bad girl " 
c06-100-s01-03 === ones ) , is becoming quite an accomplished actress . 
c06-116-s00-00 === Susan Hayward plays the wife sharply 
c06-116-s00-01 === and sweetly . Ma
c06-116-s01-00 === son is always good for 
c06-116-s01-01 === a glower . 
c06-116-s02-00 === And Miss Newmar is a 
c06-116-s02-01 === stunner in every sense of the word . 
c06-116-s03-00 === According to the script she was once

c06-116-s05-00 === IL GRIDO ( The Cry ) - Paris Pullman - 
c06-116-s05-01 === is an earlier essay in atmospheric 
c06-116-s05-02 === meandering by the L'Avventura man , 
c06-116-s05-03 === Michelangelo Antonioni . 
c06-128-s00-00 === ON a March evening in 1932 in the New 
c06-128-s00-01 === Jersey family household the nursemaid 
c06-128-s00-02 === tiptoed into the baby's room to see that 
c06-128-s00-03 === 20-month-old Charles Jun. was sleeping . 
c06-128-s01-00 === Bending over the cot , she suddenly realised 
c06-128-s01-01 === that there was no sound of breathing . 
c06-128-s02-00 === She thrust out her hand - and felt 
c06-128-s02-01 === emptiness . 
c06-128-s03-00 === A FEW minutes later the father 
c06-128-s03-01 === gripping a loaded rifle , told his wife : 
d06-008-s00-00 === To ridicule them only pushes them farther 
d06-008-s00-01 === into themselves , so that they become 
d06-008-s00-02 === unable to speak about it to anybody and 
d06-008-s00-03 === the seeds of any amount of trouble are sown , 
d06-008-s00-04 === the harvest of which may still be being 
d06-008-s00-05 === reaped at forty or fifty . 
d06-008-s01-00 === Far better to 
d06-008-s01-01 === agree with a child that a particular 
d06-008-s01-02 === situation is frightening , and then to face 
d06-008-s01-03 === it together until the child can see how 
d06-008-s01-04 === unnecessary its fears were . 
d06-015-s00-00 === A little more honesty , even if one refrains from going into 
d06-015-s00-01 === too many details , would help many a child to make a 
d06-015-s00-02 === proper adjustment to life as it grows up . 
d06-015-s01-00 === Let us look 
d06-015-s01-01 === at Jesus . 
d06-015-s02-00 === We do not , I think , see there a life without fear . 
d06-015-s03-00 === There are several instances where he seemed unable to go 
d06-015-s03-01 === on . 
d06-020-s00-00 === In Gethsemane He prayed that the cup 
d06-020-s00-01 === should pass from Him . 
d06-020-s01-00 === Jesus shows us 
d06-020-s01-01 === the way to face life . 
d06-020-s02-00 === To see all the latent 
d06-020-s02-01 === frightening possibilities and yet by facing 
d06-020-s02-02 === them and knowing God is with us and 
d06-020-s02-03 === that , with Him , there is nothing that can 
d06-020-s02-04 === finally defeat us . 
d06-020-s03-00 === More than that , that God 
d06-020-s03-01 === has something important to do with our 
d06-020-s03-02 === lives and that the nearer we get to Him , 
d06-020-s03-03 === the stronger we become . 
d06-030-s00-00 === Amen . 
d06-030-s01-00 === MOST people would probably regard tiredness as a 
d06-030-s01-01 === purely physical thing . 
d06-030-s02-00 === The cure for which is sleep . 
d06-030-s03-00 === This is only 
d06-030-s03-01 === partly true . 
d06-030-s04-00 === Many people wake up tired of a morning and no 
d06-030-s04-01 === amount of rest seems to make any difference . 
d06-030-s05-00 === Sleep , to be 
d06-030-s05-01 === effective , must be of that child-like quality which comes 
d06-030-s05-02 === from innocence . 
d06-046-s00-00 === Even more simply , test your own reactions 
d06-046-s00-01 === to different situations . 
d06-046-s01-00 === There are some which 
d06-046-s01-01 === bring on an almost immediate feeling of 
d06-046-s01-02 === tiredness - such as when your wife mentions 
d06-046-s01-03 === the washing-up - while others , if they 
d06-046-s01-04 === refer to something you like doing , bring a 
d06-046-s01-05 === veritable surge of energy . 
d06-046-s02-00 === Many a girl who 
d06-046-s02-01 === is ' too tired to help mum ' will later jump 
d06-046-s02-02 === up with no apparent tiredness at all when 
d06-046-s02-03 === her boy friend calls and go for a long walk . 
d06-050-s00-00 === Nor is she necessarily being deceitful . 
d06-050-s01-00 === She really did feel tired 
d06-050-s01-01 === until the mind got the necessary injection of a fresh - and an 
d06-050-s01-02 === attractive - interest ! 
d06-050-s02-00 === Tiredness has , therefore , as much to do 
d06-050-s02-01 === with our mental state as with our physical exhaustion . 
d06-050-s03-00 === A 
d06-050-s03-01 === disturbed mind can bring the healthiest body to a sense 
d06-050-s03-02 === of fatigue . 
d06-050-s04-00 === They wonder why they get no rest at night , 
d06-050-s04-01 === even if they do sleep . 
d06-063-s00-00 === In the days when most people were born , 
d06-063-s00-01 === lived and died within the boundaries of 
d06-063-s00-02 === the village , it was not difficult for anybody 
d06-063-s00-03 === to live a day at a time . 
d06-063-s01-00 === Even those who 
d06-063-s01-01 === held a high and responsible office lived in 
d06-063-s01-02 === far greater simplicity than their successors .
d06-063-s02-00 === When news from the Continent took days , 
d06-063-s02-01 === from America weeks , from the Far East , 
d06-063-s02-02 === months , even a Prime Minister could go to 
d06-063-s02-03 === sleep in blissful ignorance of what might 
d06-063-s02-04 === be happening at the other end of England , 
d06-082-s00-00 === If we ever stopped to consider how much energy - and time - 
d06-082-s00-01 === we lose this way in the course of a day we would be 
d06-082-s00-02 === staggered . 
d06-082-s01-00 === Some of it is inevitable , and we do not want to 
d06-082-s01-01 === become too pernickety . 
d06-082-s02-00 === Nevertheless , we could all probably 
d06-082-s02-01 === be a little more orderly for we so frequently just muddle 
d06-082-s02-02 === through . 
d07-082-s00-00 === ( Actually , the Mishnah quotes two further proof 
d07-082-s00-01 === texts and the Gemara explains why these , 
d07-082-s00-02 === too , are necessary , but a careful examination 
d07-082-s00-03 === of that passage makes it clear that these are 
d07-082-s00-04 === not quoted here because they are not 
d07-082-s00-05 === necessary to prove the point made by 
d07-082-s00-06 === R. Joshua b. Levi . ) 
d07-082-s01-00 === Finally , we note that 
d07-082-s01-01 === the comment of Rami bar Rabh is quoted 
d07-082-s01-02 === elsewhere . 
d07-085-s00-00 === From the above it follows that here , once again , 
d07-085-s00-01 === we have a good illustration of how a 
d07-085-s00-02 === sugya has been fashioned from material 
d07-085-s00-03 === already in the hands of the Redactors . 
d07-085-s01-00 === The sugya is built around the saying of 
d07-085-s01-01 === R. Joshua b. Levi . 
d07-085-s02-00 === The proof text for the 
d07-085-s02-01 === reading of the Book of Esther is quoted 
d07-085-s02-02 === with the comment given by Samuel . 
d07-089-s00-00 === ( This is probably to be understood as a well- 
d07-089-s00-01 === known comment on the verse ; quoted by 
d07-089-s00-02 === Samuel in support of his thesis and quoted
d07-089-s00-03 === by the Gemara in support of R. Joshua b. 
d07-089-s00-04 === Levi's thesis ! ) 
d07-089-s01-00 === The proof text of greeting by 
d07-089-s01-01 === the divine Name is taken from the Mishnah . 
d07-089-s02-00 === There is no reference to the Mishnah here 
d07-089-s02-01 === because the Mishnah deals with the 
d07-089-s02-02 === actual practice of greeting by the divine 
d07-089-s02-03 === Name and the Gemara here quotes the 
d07-089-s02-04 === texts to support the thesis of R. Joshua b. Levi . 
d07-093-s00-00 === The question and answer with regard to the 
d07-093-s00-01 === need for the text of the angel are quoted 
d07-093-s00-02 === here in the same words in which they are 
d07-093-s00-03 === quoted in the discussion on the Mishnah . 
d07-093-s01-00 === This can either mean that both sugyas are 
d07-093-s01-01 === quoting a well-known question and 
d07-093-s01-02 === answer or that our sugya is quoting from 
d07-093-s01-03 === the longer sugya which deals with all 
d07-093-s01-04 === four texts quoted in the Mishnah . 
d07-096-s00-00 === Or it is possible that our sugya contains the 
d07-096-s00-01 === original question and answer and this is quoted
d07-096-s00-02 ===  in the other sugya . 
d07-096-s01-00 === ( This can be supported by the 
d07-096-s01-01 === use of the expression : ' Boaz did it of his own 
d07-096-s01-02 === accord but there was no approval of his action 
d07-096-s01-03 === in Heaven ' in both sugyoth . 
d07-096-s02-00 === Such an 
d07-096-s02-01 === expression appears to have been framed in 
d07-096-s02-02 === response to the particular point at issue here , 
d07-096-s02-03 === whether the Heavenly Court concurred 
d07-096-s02-04 === in the decision of the human court . ) 
d07-100-s00-00 === The proof text of bringing the tithe to the Temple 
d07-100-s00-01 === is then quoted and the interpretation of the 
d07-100-s00-02 === latter part of the verse by Rami bar Rabh 
d07-100-s00-03 === is added , not because this is at all relevant 
d07-100-s00-04 === to the discussion but because it was 
d07-100-s00-05 === a familiar interpretation which had 
d07-100-s00-06 === become so well known that it was 
d07-100-s00-07 === invariably quoted whenever the verse 
d07-100-s00-08 === itself was quoted , almost as if it were a 
d07-100-s00-09 === part of the verse . 
d07-102-s00-00 === The Gemara continues with a saying of the 
d07-102-s00-01 === Palestinian teacher , R. Eleazar ( 3rd Cent. ) : 
d07-102-s01-00 === ' The Holy Spirit manifested itself in three places : 
d07-102-s01-01 === the court of Shem , the court of Samuel of Ramah , 
d07-102-s01-02 === and the court of Solomon . ' 
d07-102-s02-00 === The place of this 
d07-102-s02-01 === saying here is obvious , it follows naturally 
d07-102-s02-02 === on the saying of R. Joshua b. Levi which 
d07-102-s02-03 === deals with a similar theme . 
e07-000-s00-00 === WE have not yet reached the stage in Britain 
e07-000-s00-01 === when 50 planes are engaged in spreading 1,500 tons 
e07-000-s00-02 === of DDT and fuel oil over 3 million acres or when 
e07-000-s00-03 === 20 million acres are sprayed with dieldrin . 
e07-000-s01-00 === An eye- 
e07-000-s01-01 === witness described one sprayed area as literally rank with 
e07-000-s01-02 === the stench of small game and birds dead from insecti- 
e07-000-s01-03 === cide poisoning . 
g03-049-s00-00 === Although his ideas were diametrically opposed 
g03-049-s00-01 === to those of parsons he got on wonderfully well 
g03-049-s00-02 === with them , particularly those who , like the Rev. 
g03-049-s00-03 === Conrad Noel , the eloquent leader of 
g03-049-s00-04 === the Church Socialist League , genuinely advocated 
g03-049-s00-05 === socialism . 
g03-049-s01-00 === With such men , who had the 
g03-049-s01-01 === courage of their convictions and their 
g03-049-s01-02 === Christianity , common ground could be found . 
g05-098-s00-00 === So far had our thinking led us in this matter of the 
g05-098-s00-01 === " Werewolves " that we had contemplated the necessity of very 
g05-098-s00-02 === special precautions to guard the lives of our airmen . 
g05-098-s01-00 === Particular 
g05-098-s01-01 === hatred , we felt , was bound to be aimed at the representatives of 
g05-098-s01-02 === those who had , over the years , spread such ghastly havoc , destruction 
g05-098-s01-03 === and death over Germany , causing such wholesale slaughter among

h06-000-s00-04 === whether or not they result in injury . 
h06-000-s01-00 === Appendix 20 
h06-000-s01-01 === gives figures of dangerous occurrences reported in 
h06-000-s01-02 === 1960 ; the types of occurrence which have to be 
h06-000-s01-03 === reported are set out in the heading to the Appendix . 
h06-003-s00-00 === The total number of dangerous occurrences reported 
h06-003-s00-01 === during the year was 1,409 , an increase of 111 over 
h06-003-s00-02 === the total for 1959 . 
h06-003-s01-00 === However , the number of 
h06-003-s01-01 === notifiable accidents associated with occurrences fell 
h06-003-s01-02 === from 252 ( 31 of them fatal ) in 1959 to 
h06-003-s01-03 === 245 ( 22 fatal ) in 1960 . 
h06-003-s02-00 === The main increase in 
h06-003-s02-01 === the numbers of occurrences reported occurred in the 
h06-003-s02-02 === category of those due to the collapse or 
h06-003-s02-03 === failure of a crane , derrick , winch or hoist , where 
h06-003-s02-04 === there was an increase of almost one-third from 
h06-003-s02-05 === 335 to 438 . 
h06-079-s00-00 === The equipment takes two forms - an insulating 
h06-079-s00-01 === guard on the jib of the crane , intended to 
h06-079-s00-02 === prevent direct contact with the line , and 
h06-079-s00-03 === electronic equipment with a sensitive probe 
h06-079-s00-04 === mounted slightly forward of the head of 
h06-079-s00-05 === the jib and with electronic assembly 
h06-079-s00-06 === and warning apparatus in the driver's 
h06-079-s00-07 === cab . 
h06-079-s01-00 === Improved designs of both forms 
h06-079-s01-01 === are being tried out at present . 
h06-082-s00-00 === There is , however , a danger that workers 
h06-082-s00-01 === will rely too much on fixed devices because 
h06-082-s00-02 === they fail to recognise their limitations . 
h06-082-s01-00 === It is therefore safer both in principle and 
h06-082-s01-01 === practice to keep the worker away from 
h06-082-s01-02 === overhead lines wherever possible , e.g. , by 
h06-082-s01-03 === ( 1 ) re-routing the line , ( 2 ) putting the supply 
h06-082-s01-04 === underground , ( 3 ) making the line 
h06-082-s01-05 === dead ( after consultation with the supply 
h06-082-s01-06 === authority ) , ( 4 ) providing barriers at a safe 
h06-082-s01-07 === distance to prevent vehicles from approaching 
h06-085-s00-00 === It is also important to remember that on 
h06-085-s00-01 === lines carrying the higher voltages flashover 
h06-085-s00-02 === from the line may take place without 
h06-085-s00-03 === actual contact . 
h06-085-s01-00 === A new type of 
h06-085-s01-01 === machine has recently been developed for 
h06-085-s01-02 === the automatic rolling of sole leather 
h06-085-s01-03 === bends . 
h06-085-s02-00 === The sheet of leather is placed 
h06-085-s02-01 === on a sliding feed tray outside the 
h06-085-s02-02 === danger zone and is then pushed 
h06-085-s02-03 === forward between two platens , the upper 
h06-085-s02-04 === one carrying a set of small rollers . 
h06-089-s00-00 === The lower platen , which supports the 
h06-089-s00-01 === leather , is raised hydraulically to bring 
h06-089-s00-02 === it into contact with the rollers on the upper 
h06-089-s00-03 === platen , which is then caused to make 
h06-089-s00-04 === several horizontal oscillations so that the 
h06-089-s00-05 === leather is rolled and pressed at the same time . 
h06-089-s01-00 === The danger zone between the platens is fenced 
h06-089-s01-01 === by a guard which is interlocked with the 
h06-089-s01-02 === hydraulic valve and the press is also 
h06-089-s01-03 === sequentially operated : the closing of the shutter 
h06-089-s01-04 === starts the machine , the rest of the cycle 
h06-089-s01-05 === following automatically . 
h06-092-s00-00 === A new method of applying sand to the 
h06-092-s00-01 === faces of green bricks has recently been 
h06-092-s00-02 === developed . 
h06-092-s01-00 === In the case of wire-cut bricks 
h06-092-s01-01 === the column of clay from the pug-mill is 
h06-092-s01-02 === carried by a short length of belt 
h06-092-s01-03 === conveyor to the sanding plant . 
h06-092-s02-00 === This consists basically of a vibrating 
h06-092-s02-01 === hopper from which the sand is 
h06-092-s02-02 === distributed to all four faces by a 
h06-092-s02-03 === system of slots , scrapers and worms . 
h06-096-s00-00 === The conveyor is broken at this point to 
h06-096-s00-01 === enable the sand to be applied to 
h06-096-s00-02 === the under surface of the column , which 
h06-096-s00-03 === passes on through two pairs of 
h06-096-s00-04 === vibrating rollers which embed the sand 
h06-096-s00-05 === firmly in the surfaces and is finally 
h06-096-s00-06 === cut into bricks at the wire cutting 
h06-096-s00-07 === table . 
j06-000-s00-00 ===  All stages of Calanus , for example , 
j06-000-s00-01 === seem to migrate on some occasions while 
j06-000-s00-02 === any stage may not on others .
j06-000-s01-00 ===  Such data 
j06-000-s01-01 === cannot yet be rationalized . 
j06-000-s02-00 === Where 
j06-000-s02-01 === information is less extensive , however , it is 
j06-000-s02-02 === possible to find some regularity in the 
j06-000-s02-03 === observations . 
j06-000-s03-00 === Thus in Euphausia superba 
j06-000-s03-01 === from the Antarctic , the metanauplii remain 
j06-000-s03-02 === in deep water , the later larval stages 
j06-000-s03-03 === migrate diurnally , and the adolescents 
j06-000-s03-04 === stay permanently at the surface . 
j06-005-s00-00 === The migrating stages all come from 100-250 
j06-005-s00-01 === meters , and the time of their arrival at 
j06-005-s00-02 === the surface is directly related to their 
j06-005-s00-03 === swimming capacity : 3rd ( oldest ) 
j06-005-s00-04 === calyptopis from 1800-2200 hr ; 2nd , 
j06-005-s00-05 === from 2200-0200 hr ; and 1st , from 0200-0600 hr .
j06-005-s01-00 ===  Similar ontogenetic differences are apparent 
j06-005-s01-01 === in Bosmina coregoni whose adults remain 
j06-005-s01-02 === at the surface while the young migrate 
j06-005-s01-03 === to and from a depth of 50 meters .
j06-008-s00-00 ===  Such permanent occurrence at the surface 
j06-008-s00-01 === could of course be considered the extreme 
j06-008-s00-02 === of a variable day depth .
j06-008-s01-00 ===  The effect of 
j06-008-s01-01 === day depths upon the surfacing of various 
j06-008-s01-02 === animals has been reviewed elsewhere . 
j06-008-s02-00 === c .
j06-008-s02-01 ===  Anomalies . 
j06-008-s03-00 === In spite of the variability 
j06-008-s03-01 === of migrational behavior , some kinds 
j06-008-s03-02 === of anomalies may be recognized . 
j06-008-s04-00 === Vertical movement occurs in some forms 
j06-008-s04-01 === apparently in the reverse manner to 
j06-008-s04-02 === that commonly met . 
j06-014-s00-00 === Such reversed migrations are known for 
j06-014-s00-01 === Acartia clausi , A. longiremis , Nyctiphanes 
j06-014-s00-02 === couchii , Evadne sp. , Oithona nana , Daphnia 
j06-014-s00-03 === lumholzi , Stages 4 , 5 , and adult of 
j06-014-s00-04 === Calanus finmarchicus , Diaptomus banforanus , 
j06-014-s00-05 === and Cyclops bicuspidatus . 
j06-014-s01-00 === An echo-producing 
j06-014-s01-01 === layer , which the authors think probably consists 
j06-014-s01-02 === of euphausiids , has also been described 
j06-014-s01-03 === as , in part , regularly moving in a reverse 
j06-014-s01-04 === manner .
j06-014-s02-00 ===  Most of these records are well 
j06-014-s02-01 === substantiated and involve whole populations 
j06-014-s02-02 === rather than aberrant individuals . 
j06-018-s00-00 === But normal movements have been 
j06-018-s00-01 === reported also for the same species in 
j06-018-s00-02 === the case of five of these examples 
j06-018-s00-03 === and for other species in the same 
j06-018-s00-04 === genera for the remaining Evadne , 
j06-018-s00-05 === Daphnia , and Diaptomus . 
j06-018-s01-00 === Many 
j06-018-s01-01 === forms sometimes migrate and on other 
j06-018-s01-02 === occasions do not , but a few 
j06-018-s01-03 === appear to remain permanently at
j06-018-s01-04 ===  one level . 
j06-018-s02-00 === Considering the widespread 
j06-018-s02-01 === incidence of migration in the 
j06-022-s00-00 === The most clearly substantiated case 
j06-022-s00-01 === is that of the copepod Anomalocera 
j06-022-s00-02 === patersoni , which remains permanently 
j06-022-s00-03 === at the surface . 
j06-022-s01-00 === Among other copepods 
j06-022-s01-01 === Rhincalanus gigas , Calanoides acutus , 
j06-022-s01-02 === Microcalanus pygmaeus , Oithona 
j06-022-s01-03 === frigida , and Centropages typicus are 
j06-022-s01-04 === reported as showing no migration . 
j06-022-s02-00 === The predaceous cladoceran Bythotrephes 
j06-022-s02-01 === longimanus also remains at one 
j06-022-s02-02 === level , about 10 meters down . 
j06-026-s00-00 === In view of its well-known normal 
j06-026-s00-01 === migration , the occurrence of Calanus 
j06-026-s00-02 === finmarchicus in the summer at 
j06-026-s00-03 === the surface in bright sunlight 
j06-026-s00-04 === may justly be considered anomalous 
j06-026-s01-00 === . This phenomenon has nevertheless been 
j06-026-s01-01 === recorded many times , and such 
j06-026-s01-02 === surface Calanus may be present in 
j06-026-s01-03 === enormous numbers , breaking the surface 
j06-026-s01-04 === into small circular ripples like 
j06-030-s00-00 === It seems likely that a continuous 
j06-030-s00-01 === interchange was taking place between 
j06-030-s00-02 === the population at the surface and 
j06-030-s00-03 === that in deeper water .
j06-030-s01-00 ===  A second 
j06-030-s01-01 === group whose normal vertical
j06-030-s01-02 ===  migration is sufficiently well 
j06-030-s01-03 === known to make daytime 
j06-030-s01-04 === occurrence at the surface 
j06-030-s01-05 === rank as anomalous is the 
j06-030-s01-06 === Euphausiacea . 
j06-030-s02-00 === There are numerous 
j06-030-s02-01 === records of euphausiids swimming 
j06-034-s00-00 === 2 . Mechanisms .
j06-034-s01-00 ===  The majority of 
j06-034-s01-01 === vertical migrations undoubtedly 
j06-034-s01-02 === result from active swimming 
j06-034-s01-03 === although passive movement through 
j06-034-s01-04 === the water has been suggested on 
j06-034-s01-05 === various grounds . 
j06-034-s02-00 === For example , 
j06-034-s02-01 === transport in vertical currents
j06-034-s02-02 ===  resulting from temperature diff- 
j06-034-s02-03 === erences has been proposed ; diff- 
j06-034-s02-04 === erences in water viscosity after 
j06-034-s02-05 === temperature changes have also been 
j06-051-s00-00 === Downward movement may in some forms 
j06-051-s00-01 === start as a passive sinking , especially 
j06-051-s00-02 === when it occurs before dawn ; but this 
j06-051-s00-03 === must almost certainly be replaced 
j06-051-s00-04 === by the headfirst downward swimming 
j06-051-s00-05 === observed in the field . 
j06-051-s01-00 === 3 . Initiating , 
j06-051-s01-01 === controlling , and orienting factors . 
j06-051-s02-00 === The 
j06-051-s02-01 === primary dependence of diurnal 
j06-051-s02-02 === migrations upon changes in light intensity 
j06-051-s02-03 === is beyond doubt . 
j06-051-s03-00 === Yet in spite 
j06-051-s03-01 === of a great amount of work , 
j06-056-s00-00 === Loeb first suggested the importance 
j06-056-s00-01 === of light as the governing factor 
j06-056-s00-02 === but combined its influence with that 
j06-056-s00-03 === of gravity . 
j06-056-s01-00 === Later authors , in particular 
j06-056-s01-01 === Rose , have proposed that light 
j06-056-s01-02 === alone can provide an adequate 
j06-056-s01-03 === mechanism if the animals have , 
j06-056-s01-04 === and select by exploration , a 
j06-056-s01-05 === zone of optimum light intensity . 
j06-056-s02-00 === This view has been enlarged
j06-056-s02-01 ===  with a suggestion that both 
m06-019-s00-00 === Though your wings and your scars are new , 
m06-019-s00-01 === you may join us . '
m06-019-s01-00 ===  ' I am Lily-yo .
m06-019-s02-00 ===  We three 
m06-019-s02-01 === are humans .

m06-019-s04-01 ===  not join you . ' T
m06-019-s05-00 === he Captives grunted in boredom . 
m06-019-s06-00 === The Chief Captive spoke again . 
m06-019-s07-00 === ' Always this 
m06-019-s07-01 === talk from you of the Heavy World ! 
m06-019-s08-00 === You have

m06-019-s09-00 === You are flymen , we are human .
m06-019-s10-00 === You

m06-031-s00-00 === ' But we - '

m06-031-s02-00 === ' We are - '
m06-031-s03-00 === ' Be silent , woman , and listen , ' Band Appa Bondi said .
m06-031-s04-00 === ' We know much , ' repeated the Chief Captive . 
m06-031-s05-00 === ' Some 
m06-031-s06-00 === All who make the journey from 
m06-031-s06-01 === the Heavy World become changed . 
m06-031-s07-00 === Some die . 
m06-031-s08-00 === Most live

m06-042-s01-01 === tigerfly is not a tigerfly until it changes .
m06-042-s02-00 === So humans 
m06-042-s02-01 === change . ' 
m06-042-s03-00 === ' I cannot know what he says , ' Haris said 
m06-042-s03-01 === stubbornly , throwing himself down . 
m06-042-s04-00 === But Lily-yo and 
m06-048-s00-00 === ' To this True World , as you call it , we come to die , ' 
m06-048-s00-01 === Lily-yo said , doubtingly . 
m06-048-s01-00 === The Captive with the 
m06-048-s01-01 === fleshless jaw said , ' The grub of the tigerfly thinks 
m06-048-s01-02 === it dies when it changes into a tigerfly . ' 
m06-048-s02-00 === ' You are still 
m06-048-s02-01 === young , ' said the Chief Captive . 
m06-048-s03-00 === ' You begin newly here . 
m06-048-s04-00 === Where are your souls ? ' L
m06-048-s05-00 === ily-yo and Flor looked at 
m06-048-s05-01 === each other . 
m06-048-s06-00 === In their flight from the 4wiltmilt they had 
m06-048-s06-01 === heedlessly thrown down their souls . 
m06-056-s00-00 === Haris had trampled on his . 
m06-056-s01-00 === It was unthinkable ! 
m06-056-s02-00 === ' You see . 
m06-056-s03-00 === You needed them no more . 
m06-056-s04-00 === You are still 
m06-056-s04-01 === young . 
m06-056-s05-00 === You may be able to have babies . 
m06-056-s06-00 === Some of those

m06-056-s07-00 === The Captive with 
m06-056-s07-01 === the boneless arms added , 
m06-056-s08-00 === ' Some may be born wrong ,

m06-067-s01-00 === ' Why are

m06-067-s02-00 === ' Because we know all things , ' the 
m06-067-s02-01 === Chief Captive said . 
m06-067-s03-00 === Suddenly his second head roused 
m06-067-s03-01 === itself and declared , 
m06-067-s04-00 === ' To be a good shape is not all

m06-067-s05-00 === To know is also good .

m06-076-s02-00 === ' Do you say that you poor

m06-076-s02-02 === at last . 
m06-076-s03-00 === ' We do . ' 
m06-076-s04-00 === ' Then why are you captives ? ' 
m06-076-s05-00 === The flyman with ear lobes and thumbs connected , 
m06-076-s05-01 === making his perpetual little gesture of protest , 
m06-076-s05-02 === spoke for the first time . 
m06-083-s00-00 === ' To rule is to serve , woman . 
m06-083-s01-00 === Those who bear power 
m06-083-s01-01 === are slaves to it . 
m06-083-s02-00 === Only an outcast is free . 
m06-083-s03-00 === Because 
m06-083-s03-01 === we are Captives , we have the time to talk and 
m06-083-s03-02 === think and plan and know . 
m06-083-s04-00 === Those who know 
m06-083-s04-01 === command the knives of others . ' 
m06-083-s05-00 === ' No hurt will

m06-083-s06-01 === from harm . ' 
m06-091-s00-00 === ' No ! ' the Chief Captive said with both mouths . 
m06-091-s01-00 === ' Before she can enjoy , Lily-yo and her companion 
m06-091-s01-01 === Flor - this other man creature is plainly useless - 
m06-091-s01-02 === must help our great plan . ' 
m06-091-s02-00 === ' The invasion ? ' Bondi 
m06-091-s02-01 === asked . 
m06-091-s03-00 === ' What else ? 
m06-091-s04-00 === Flor and Lily-yo , you arrive 
m06-091-s04-01 === here at a good time . 
m06-091-s05-00 === Memories of the Heavy World 
m06-091-s05-01 === and its savage life are still fresh in you . 
m06-098-s00-00 === We need such memories . 
m06-098-s01-00 === So we ask you to go 
m06-098-s01-01 === back there on a great plan we have . ' 
m06-098-s02-00 === ' Go back ? ' 
m06-098-s02-01 === gasped Flor . 
m06-098-s03-00 === ' Yes . 
m06-098-s04-00 === We plan to attack the Heavy 
m06-098-s04-01 === World . 
m06-098-s05-00 === You must help to lead our force . ' 
m06-098-s06-00 === The long 
m06-098-s06-01 === afternoon of eternity wore on , that long golden road
m06-098-s06-02 === of an afternoon that would somewhere lead to 
m06-098-s06-03 === everlasting night . 
m06-106-s00-00 === Motion there was , but motion without event - except 
m06-106-s00-01 === for those negligible events that seemed so large to 
m06-106-s00-02 === the creatures participating in them . 
m06-106-s01-00 === For Lily-yo , Flor 
m06-106-s01-01 === and Haris there were many events . 
m06-106-s02-00 === Chief of these was 
m06-106-s02-01 === that they learned to fly properly . 
m06-106-s03-00 === The pains associated 
m06-106-s03-01 === with their wings soon died away as the wonderful 
m06-106-s03-02 === new flesh and tendon strengthened . 
m06-106-s04-00 === To sail up in the 
m06-106-s04-01 === light gravity became an increasing delight - the ugly 
m06-106-s04-02 === flopping movements of flymen on the Heavy World 
m06-106-s04-03 === had no place here 
n02-098-s00-00 === She wavered , and at last said 
n02-098-s00-01 === slowly , 
n02-098-s01-00 === " If you must drag the truth 
n02-098-s01-01 === out of me , I must ask you to regard 
n02-098-s01-02 === it as confidential . " 
n02-098-s02-00 === " My dear Beryl , 
n02-098-s02-01 === don't tell me anything , if you 'd rather 
n02-098-s02-02 === not . " 
n02-098-s03-00 === He was clearly startled by her 
n02-098-s03-01 === words . 
n02-098-s04-00 === " But remember , it was you , 
n02-098-s04-01 === not I , who started this conversation . " 
n02-104-s00-00 === " I know . 
n02-104-s01-00 === Absurd as it may seem , I didn't want 
n02-104-s01-01 === you to think badly of me . " 
n02-104-s02-00 === She turned away 
n02-104-s02-01 === from him to fondle Judy , who , sensing something 
n02-104-s02-02 === amiss , was nudging her in the endeavour to 
n02-104-s02-03 === gain her attention . 
n02-104-s03-00 === " The truth is that 
n02-104-s03-01 === if I had absolutely insisted on sailing at the 
n02-104-s03-02 === time originally arranged , Sir John would 
n02-104-s03-03 === have had it in for Guy . 
n02-109-s00-00 === You see , it was , apparently , through a mistake 
n02-109-s00-01 === on Guy's part that we missed seeing the 
n02-109-s00-02 === flamingoes our first morning on the island . " 
n02-109-s01-00 === " What harm could possibly have come to Forrest 
n02-109-s01-01 === through Sir John's nonsense ? " 
n02-109-s02-00 === Piers could 
n02-109-s02-01 === hardly have spoken with more contempt . 
n02-109-s03-00 === A bully like that respects anyone who 
n02-109-s03-01 === dares to stand up to him . " 
n02-114-s00-00 === Beryl tried to suppress the thought that this was 
n02-114-s00-01 === precisely the remark she had made to Guy .
n02-114-s01-00 === She said icily 
n02-114-s02-00 === , " As you pride yourself on 
n02-114-s02-01 === your knowledge of all the affairs of the 
n02-114-s02-02 === island I needn't tell you that Sir John 
n02-114-s02-03 === Graybury is one of Mr. Hewson's most 
n02-114-s02-04 === important customers . " 
n02-114-s03-00 === " So what ? 
n02-114-s04-00 === You 're not 
n02-114-s04-01 === trying to say that Hewson would victimise 
n02-114-s04-02 === Forrest for behaving with ordinary moral 
n02-114-s04-03 === courage ! 
n02-120-s00-00 === He 's quite capable of telling Sir John to take 
n02-120-s00-01 === himself and his business to an unmention- 
n02-120-s00-02 === able destination . " 
n02-120-s01-00 === " There 's a difference 
n02-120-s01-01 === between what a senior and a junior 
n02-120-s01-02 === partner can do , " was her quick reply . 
n02-120-s02-00 === " What they can bring off ! 
n02-120-s03-00 === I 'll admit that . 
n02-120-s04-00 === But Forrest might at least have tried . 
n02-120-s05-00 === He 's 
n02-120-s05-01 === pretty spineless ! " 
n02-127-s00-00 === " You think you could have carried more weight 
n02-127-s00-01 === with Sir John ? " she enquired cuttingly . 
n02-127-s01-00 === " For all your good opinion of yourself , 
n02-127-s01-01 === I doubt it . 
n02-127-s02-00 === He 's about as easy to push around 
n02-127-s02-01 === as - as a grounded whale ! " 
n02-127-s03-00 === He had to smile 
n02-127-s03-01 === at that , but went on airily , 
n02-127-s04-00 === " I 'd have made 
n02-127-s04-01 === an attempt to show my lady-love that I 
n02-127-s04-02 === put her interests before my own . 
n06-074-s00-00 === He rode down to where I was waiting . 
n06-074-s01-00 === I was 
n06-074-s01-01 === thinking what a skill he had for reading 
n06-074-s01-02 === my mind . 
n06-074-s02-00 === " This would be as good a place 
n06-074-s02-01 === for a hold-up as any , " he said , reining in 
n06-074-s02-02 === near me . 
n06-074-s03-00 === " Yes , " I said . 
n06-074-s04-00 === " It 'll be here to- 
n06-074-s04-01 === morrow as likely as not . " 
n06-074-s05-00 === I paused . 
n06-074-s06-00 === " Miss 
n06-074-s06-01 === Jeannie 'll be on that coach , Dan . " 
n06-082-s00-00 === " Yes , " he said . 
n06-082-s01-00 === " I know . " 
n06-082-s02-00 === " No harm must come 
n06-082-s02-01 === to her , Dan . " 
n06-082-s03-00 === " She 'll be all right . 
n06-082-s04-00 === It 's the 
n06-082-s04-01 === men who 'll be after that coach I 'm interested 
n06-082-s04-02 === in , Johnny . " 
n06-082-s05-00 === " I know . 
n06-082-s06-00 === But if lead starts 
n06-082-s06-01 === flying she might be in danger . " 
n06-082-s07-00 === " That 's so . 
n06-082-s08-00 === But I reckon they 'll be too busy shooting at 
n06-082-s08-01 === us to bother with the coach and the folks 
n06-082-s08-02 === in it . " 
n06-092-s00-00 === " Maybe , " I said . 
n06-092-s01-00 === " But we 've got to remember 
n06-092-s01-01 === that girl all the time , Dan . 
n06-092-s02-00 === I feel kind 
n06-092-s02-01 === of responsible for her . " 
n06-092-s03-00 === " Of course , " he said , 
n06-092-s03-01 === giving me one of his strange looks . 
n06-092-s04-00 === Then he 
n06-092-s04-01 === turned the conversation . 
n06-092-s05-00 === " Let 's ride over 
n06-092-s05-01 === and have a look at the mining camp .
n06-092-s06-00 === After all it 's them we 're supposed to be 
n06-092-s06-01 === working for , as well as the townsfolk and 
n06-092-s06-02 === the agency detective . "
n06-100-s00-00 === With something of a start I remembered the 
n06-100-s00-01 === man who 'd brought us into this business . 
n06-100-s01-00 === " Maybe you don't know about Appleton , 
n06-100-s01-01 === Dan ? " 
n06-100-s02-00 === " Know what ? " 
n06-100-s03-00 === " That he 's dead , " 
n06-100-s03-01 === I said . 
n06-100-s04-00 === I watched him because I was always 
n06-100-s04-01 === fascinated by the way he looked when you 
n06-100-s04-02 === tried to surprise him . 
n06-100-s05-00 === " Dead ? " he said . 
n06-100-s06-00 === " Yes . 
n06-100-s07-00 === Dead . 
n06-100-s08-00 === Shuffled out of the deck . 
n06-100-s09-00 === Blasted 
n06-100-s09-01 === down with a shotgun outside the Palace 
n06-100-s09-02 === last night . " 
n06-111-s00-00 === " Fenton or Somers , " he said . 
n06-111-s01-00 === " Or the Town 
n06-111-s01-01 === Marshal , " I added .
n06-111-s02-00 === His face was fixed , 
n06-111-s02-01 === unreadable as a rock . 
n06-111-s03-00 === " Let 's get over to the 
n06-111-s03-01 === mining camp , " he said abruptly . 
n06-111-s04-00 === He wheeled 
n06-111-s04-01 === his horse back off the trail and up the slope 
n06-111-s04-02 === leading to the ridge . 
n06-111-s05-00 === I followed . 
n06-111-s06-00 === From the 
n06-111-s06-01 === top you could see something of the wild hill 
n06-111-s06-02 === country that lay all round Gilburg Crossing . 
n06-119-s00-00 === The air was fresh and clear and you 
n06-119-s00-01 === could see far over west and north for many 
n06-119-s00-02 === miles . 
n06-119-s01-00 === The real high country of the Rockies 
n06-119-s01-01 === lifted up in the distance like a pale water- 
n06-119-s01-02 === colour drawing . 
n06-119-s02-00 === Between us and that lay 
n06-119-s02-01 === a vast stretch of hills , canyons , buttes and 
n06-119-s02-02 === malpais . 
n06-123-s00-00 === The mine-workings lie north of the town , " 
n06-123-s00-01 === said Dan . 
n06-123-s01-00 === " If we head west we ought to 
n06-123-s01-01 === cut the trail leading from Gilburg to the north . " 
n06-123-s02-00 === So we swung west , making slow going over 
n06-123-s02-01 === rough country , sliding on shale , climbing down 
n06-123-s02-02 === into draws , circling a big mesa by a 
n06-123-s02-03 === four or five mile valley , sandy-floored . 
n06-123-s03-00 === It 
n06-123-s03-01 === got hotter as the day wore on and we rested 
n06-123-s03-02 === gratefully by a small creek where we watered 
n06-123-s03-03 === the horses and drank enough to cure our 
n06-123-s03-04 === thirst . 
n06-128-s00-00 === An hour's riding brought us to a trail that 
n06-128-s00-01 === we figured would lead to the miners' camp . 
n06-128-s01-00 === We turned north into it and after about four 
n06-128-s01-01 === miles it led into a small canyon which 
n06-128-s01-02 === opened out into a wide shallow draw . 
n06-128-s02-00 === Here in a dried-up creek-bed we found 
n06-128-s02-01 === the miners at work . 
n06-128-s03-00 === They were scattered 
n06-128-s03-01 === over a fairly wide area working singly or 
n06-128-s03-02 === in pairs  
n06-133-s00-00 === We didn't approach unchallenged . 
n06-133-s01-00 === Just short 
n06-133-s01-01 === of the diggings there was a roughly-built 
n06-133-s01-02 === shack and as we got near someone inside bawled 
n06-133-s01-03 === out , 
n06-133-s02-00 === " If you come any closer , I 'll sure blow 
n06-133-s02-01 === your whiskers off . " 
n06-133-s03-00 === " Take it easy , mister , " I sang 
n06-133-s03-01 === out . 
n06-133-s04-00 === " We don't aim to come any closer and we 've 
n06-133-s04-01 === got no whiskers so as you can see . 
n06-133-s05-00 === Just you 
n06-133-s05-01 === go and tell Nick Dowd we 've come to talk 
n06-133-s05-02 === to him about what happened last night . " 
n06-140-s00-00 === " Oh , " said the unseen guard . 
n06-140-s01-00 === He blew a 
n06-140-s01-01 === whistle then , loud and shrill . 
n06-140-s02-00 === The gun barrel 
n06-140-s02-01 === peeking out through a hole in the shack never 
n06-140-s02-02 === wavered . 
n06-140-s03-00 === We sat our horses , waiting . 
n06-140-s04-00 === " Looks as 
n06-140-s04-01 === though they 're expecting trouble , " I said . 
n06-140-s05-00 === " Where 
n06-140-s05-01 === there 's gold and women there 's always trouble , " 
n06-140-s05-02 === observed Dan , shifting about in his saddle . 
n06-140-s06-00 === He 
n06-140-s06-01 === was never long on patience . 
n06-148-s00-00 === I saw several men running down towards 
n06-148-s00-01 === the shack . 
n06-148-s01-00 === They were all armed with rifles . 
n06-148-s02-00 === As the nearest of them came round the 
n06-148-s02-01 === shack , his rifle at the ready , I saw it was Nick 
n06-148-s02-02 === Dowd , still wearing his blue check shirt . 
n06-148-s03-00 === He 
n06-148-s03-01 === came up close , eyeing us suspiciously . " 
n06-148-s04-00 === We 've 
n06-148-s04-01 === come 2a-calling , " I said . 
n06-148-s05-00 === " Can't see no reason 
n06-148-s05-01 === for calling , " he said . 
n06-148-s06-00 === " Still long as you 're here 
n06-148-s06-01 === you may as well stay a while . 
n06-156-s00-00 === 'Light an' come on in . " 
n06-156-s01-00 === We dismounted and 
n06-156-s01-01 === one of the miners who 'd come along with
n06-156-s01-02 === Nick Dowd took our horses off to water . 
n06-156-s02-00 === We followed Nick Dowd into the shack . 
n06-156-s03-00 === They 'd rigged up a stove of sorts and on it 
n06-156-s03-01 === a huge blackened coffee-pot steamed . 
n06-156-s04-00 === Other 
n06-156-s04-01 === miners followed in at our heels . 
n06-156-s05-00 === Nick Dowd 
n06-156-s05-01 === found us a couple of boxes to sit on . 
n06-163-s00-00 === A small man in bib overalls and a battered 
n06-163-s00-01 === Derby hat fussed around the stove . 
n06-163-s01-00 === " 2Ain't 
n06-163-s01-01 === exactly the Ritz Hotel but we 've got our little 
n06-163-s01-02 === comforts , " said Dowd . 
n06-163-s02-00 === He introduced the men 
n06-163-s02-01 === who 'd come in as Roper Smith , Shorty , Mick 
n06-163-s02-02 === Golightly , Swede and the Sodbuster . 
n06-163-s03-00 === This last was 
n06-163-s03-01 === the little hombre in big overalls . 
n06-163-s04-00 === Very soon he 
n06-163-s04-01 === had tin mugs filled with hot black coffee 
n06-163-s04-02 === sweetened with molasses for all and for us 
n06-163-s04-03 === there were two plates of beans 
n06-169-s00-00 === " They gives you the wind , " said the Sodbuster 
n06-169-s00-01 === handing them to us , " but it 's all we got 
n06-169-s00-02 === as of now , apart from a few sacks of gold 
n06-169-s00-03 === dust . " 
n06-169-s01-00 === He winked at his partners . 
n06-169-s02-00 === They all 
n06-169-s02-01 === watched us as we ate the beans . 
n06-169-s03-00 === Then when 
n06-169-s03-01 === we 'd finished and I 'd rolled a cigarette 
n06-169-s03-02 === the man called Shorty said , " 
n06-169-s04-00 === You were saying when 
n06-169-s04-01 === you came in that 2somep'n happened last 
n06-169-s04-02 === night . " 
n06-175-s00-00 === " Yes , " I said . 
n06-175-s01-00 === " Something happened all right . 
n06-175-s02-00 === After you 'd left the meeting , mister " - I 
n06-175-s02-01 === looked across at Nick Dowd - " someone cut 
n06-175-s02-02 === down William Appleton outside the Palace 
n06-175-s02-03 === with a shotgun . " 
n06-175-s03-00 === I paused and watched my 
n06-175-s03-01 === words affect them in their different ways . 
n06-175-s04-00 === " That 's sure bad news , " said Dowd , sombrely . 
n06-175-s05-00 === " It 2jest about leaves everything wide open 
n06-175-s05-01 === for Mr. Pell and his bunch , " observed 
n06-175-s05-02 === Shorty . 
n06-182-s00-00 === The rest of the men there said nothing but 
n06-182-s00-01 === you could see they were hard hit . 
n06-182-s01-00 === They were 
n06-182-s01-01 === simple men who knew a lot maybe about 
n06-182-s01-02 === digging for gold but were babes in arms 
n06-182-s01-03 === when it came to dealing with owlhooters and 
n06-182-s01-04 === desperadoes like Pell and Fenton and the 
n06-182-s01-05 === rest . 
n06-182-s02-00 === " I guess we 'd better hold onto the gold 
n06-182-s02-01 === right 2hyar , Nick , " said the Sodbuster . 
n06-186-s00-00 === " Yeah , " said Dowd dubiously . 
n06-186-s01-00 === " 2Mebbe we 'd 
n06-186-s01-01 === better . " 
n06-186-s02-00 === Surprisingly Dan Maffrey came in at 
n06-186-s02-01 === that point . 
n06-186-s03-00 === " If you do , " he said , " you 'll be 
n06-186-s03-01 === sure asking for trouble . 
n06-186-s04-00 === They 'll be on your 
n06-186-s04-01 === necks before you can say ' knife ' . 
n06-186-s05-00 === It wouldn't 
n06-186-s05-01 === be the first time they 've held up a diggings 
n06-186-s05-02 === at gun point either . 
n06-186-s06-00 === They 've done it before 
n06-186-s06-01 === and got away with it . " 
n06-194-s00-00 === " You 're 2durned tootin' , mister , " said the man 
n06-194-s00-01 === called Roper Smith . 
n06-194-s01-00 === " We 've got five rifles among 
n06-194-s01-01 === us and a few six-shooters . 
n06-194-s02-00 === But most of us 
n06-194-s02-01 === 2ain't 2eddicated in shootin' . 
n06-194-s03-00 === It 'd be a 
n06-194-s03-01 === 2massacree , 2yessir . " 
n06-194-s04-00 === " If you 'll take a chance 
n06-194-s04-01 === on getting your gold to the bank , then we 'll 
n06-194-s04-02 === abide by what we said at the meeting , " 
n06-194-s04-03 === said Dan . 
n06-194-s05-00 === " We 'll watch the stage out of reach . " 
n06-201-s00-00 === I couldn't quite see how all this fitted in 
n06-201-s00-01 === with Dan Maffrey's aim to avenge himself 
n06-201-s00-02 === on the Fenton bunch but still it was a 
n06-201-s00-03 === handsome offer so I chimed in too . 
n06-201-s01-00 === " That 
n06-201-s01-01 === goes for me , gentlemen , " I said . 
n06-201-s02-00 === " If they do try 
n06-201-s02-01 === and hold up the stage , it 'll be a couple or 
n06-201-s02-02 === three of them , no more . 
n06-201-s03-00 === I reckon we can deal 
n06-201-s03-01 === with them all right . " 
p03-057-s00-00 === " Neither can Nigel , " smiled Diana . 
p03-057-s01-00 === " He 's saving up to get married . 
p03-057-s02-00 === Remember ? " 
p03-057-s03-00 === " I remember , " quipped the houseman , 
p03-057-s03-01 === meaning no offence , " but does he ? 
p03-057-s04-00 === That blonde was something . " 
p03-057-s05-00 === " Anybody 
p03-057-s05-01 === I know ? " she smiled . 
p03-057-s06-00 === " I think so . 
p03-057-s07-00 === I got a good look at her . 
p03-057-s08-00 === But if Nigel 
p03-057-s08-01 === wasn't there it isn't important , is it ? " 
p03-057-s09-00 === " No , " Di said immediately . 
p03-057-s10-00 === " It isn't at 
p03-057-s10-01 === all important . " 
p03-087-s00-00 === " Oh , he wasn't . 
p03-087-s01-00 === His motor-bike had 
p03-087-s01-01 === broken down outside and he noticed 
p03-087-s01-02 === your car and then you dancing with 
p03-087-s01-03 === this blonde . " 
p03-087-s02-00 === " Really ? " Nigel cocked 
p03-087-s02-01 === one eyebrow . 
p03-087-s03-00 === " Actually she was brunette 
p03-087-s03-01 === at the roots and I had a redhead on 
p03-087-s03-02 === the other arm . 
p03-087-s04-00 === He would have told 
p03-087-s04-01 === you this , too ? " 
p03-087-s05-00 === " No , " she laughed . 
p03-087-s06-00 === " He didn't actually see you . 
p03-087-s07-00 === Because 
p03-087-s07-01 === it was your car I suppose he 
p03-087-s07-02 === presumed it was you , all dressed up in 
p03-096-s00-00 === " My white or my black ? " Nigel enquired . 
p03-096-s01-00 === " Now I wonder which I wore at that 
p03-096-s01-01 === particular surgery ? " 
p03-096-s02-00 === " You are a fool , 
p03-096-s02-01 === darling , " Di said happily . 
p03-096-s03-00 === " I shall take 
p03-096-s03-01 === great pleasure in telling that young man 
p03-096-s03-02 === exactly what you were doing that 
p03-096-s03-03 === evening . " 
p03-096-s04-00 === " No , don't , " he said , after 
p03-096-s04-01 === kissing her again . 
p03-096-s05-00 === " I rather like to have 
p03-096-s05-01 === the housemen think of me as a 
p03-096-s05-02 === two-timing Don Juan . 
p03-103-s00-00 === I 'm such a dull fellow , really . " 
p03-103-s01-00 === " Dull ? " 
p03-103-s02-00 === She 
p03-103-s02-01 === couldn't believe it . 
p03-103-s03-00 === Self-deprecation 
p03-103-s03-01 === was not one of Nigel's usual attributes . 
p03-103-s04-00 === " You need your holiday , darling . 
p03-103-s05-00 === I only 
p03-103-s05-01 === wish I could go with you ! " 
p03-103-s06-00 === " Doctor 
p03-103-s06-01 === Wills , if you 're making improper suggestions ... ? " 
p03-103-s07-00 === " It would make me more interesting , 
p03-112-s00-00 === " No , it wouldn't ! " he almost snapped , 
p03-112-s00-01 === surprising her . 
p03-112-s01-00 === " You sounded like some- 
p03-112-s01-01 === body else for a moment there . 
p03-112-s02-00 === It doesn't 
p03-112-s02-01 === become you to behave like a - a tart , Di . " 
p03-112-s03-00 === " Nigel - ! " she gasped . 
p03-112-s04-00 === " I didn't mean to 
p03-112-s04-01 === behave like anything of the kind . 
p03-112-s05-00 === I 
p03-112-s05-01 === was only joking . " 
p03-112-s06-00 === " Well , don'
p03-112-s07-00 === t . It 's 
p03-112-s07-01 === miserable enough my having to take my 
p03-112-s07-02 === leave in the autumn without you 
p03-112-s07-03 === trying to be bright and gay about it . 
p06-030-s00-00 === His mouth hardened , his eyes became 
p06-030-s00-01 === steely . 
p06-030-s01-00 === ' I see . ' Sc
p06-030-s02-00 === orn lashed his 
p06-030-s02-01 === words . 
p06-030-s03-00 === ' I wonder you dared trust 
p06-030-s03-01 === him to my care . ' 
p06-030-s04-00 === ' Nicholas - ' 
p06-030-s05-00 === ' Well ! 
p06-030-s06-00 === At least I know the truth . 
p06-030-s07-00 === Truth ! ' 
p06-030-s08-00 === His gaze held hers 
p06-030-s08-01 === masterfully . 
p06-030-s09-00 === ' You wanted it so 
p06-030-s09-01 === badly - at any price . 
p06-030-s10-00 === I hope 
p06-030-s10-01 === you are satisfied . 
p06-042-s00-00 === ' And as he spoke , the thought 
p06-042-s00-01 === of Philip lying in the other 
p06-042-s00-02 === room filled him with a re- 
p06-042-s00-03 === vulsion that was homicidal . 
p06-042-s01-00 === Even in that , his hands were 
p06-042-s01-01 === tied . 
p06-042-s02-00 === He dare not precipitate 
p06-042-s02-01 === what might well be another 
p06-042-s02-02 === coronary . 
p06-042-s03-00 === And in that second 
p06-042-s03-01 === he put back his professional 
p06-042-s03-02 === mantle , and said with such 
p06-042-s03-03 === icy politeness , such withdrawn 
p06-047-s00-00 === ' I will leave you the necessary pre- 
p06-047-s00-01 === scription for the sedatives . 
p06-047-s01-00 === You 
p06-047-s01-01 === will contact your new doctor 
p06-047-s01-02 === when you reach your parents' 
p06-047-s01-03 === house . ' 
p06-047-s02-00 === She watched him flick 
p06-047-s02-01 === his fountain-pen from his 
p06-047-s02-02 === waistcoat pocket , take out 
p06-047-s02-03 === his # prescription pad , and 
p06-047-s02-04 === # scribble on it . 
p06-047-s03-00 === Then , 
p06-047-s03-02 === he tore off the leaflet and 
p06-052-s00-00 === ' Good-bye , Sandra , ' he said 
p06-052-s00-01 === with a deadly finality . 
p06-052-s01-00 === Watching 
p06-052-s01-01 === him go , unable to speak , she 
p06-052-s01-02 === felt that part of her was leaving 
p06-052-s01-03 === him . 
p06-052-s02-00 === She couldn't hate him ... 
p06-052-s03-00 === If only he would have con- 
p06-052-s03-01 === fided in her , given some expla- 
p06-052-s03-02 === nation . 
p06-052-s04-00 === Now there was no- 
p06-052-s04-01 === thing - not even friendship . 
p06-058-s00-00 === She went back to Philip . 
p06-058-s01-00 === But 
p06-058-s01-01 === all she could hear were Nicholas's 
p06-058-s01-02 === words : 
p06-058-s02-00 === ' I love you - oh , you 
p06-058-s02-01 === know that well enough . ' 
p06-058-s03-00 === Love . 
p06-058-s04-00 === She revolted against 
p06-058-s04-01 === the word . 
p06-058-s05-00 === Nicholas , Philip ... 
p06-058-s05-01 === where was happiness , or 
p06-058-s05-02 === peace of mind ? 
p06-058-s06-00 === Philip put out 
p06-058-s06-01 === a hand and grasped hers . 
p06-058-s07-00 === He needed her . 
p06-058-s08-00 === She would find 
p06-058-s08-01 === solace in that fact at least . 
p06-069-s00-00 === She had her truth . 
p06-069-s01-00 === How much had built 
p06-069-s01-01 === up from that first ideal , and how 
p06-069-s01-02 === little joy , or satisfaction , it had 
p06-069-s01-03 === given her . 
p06-069-s02-00 === ' I 'm sorry , darling . ' 
p06-069-s03-00 === He looked nervous . 
p06-069-s04-00 === It had been 
p06-069-s04-01 === hell lying there , knowing she was 
p06-069-s04-02 === talking to Nicholas and wondering 
p06-069-s04-03 === what they were saying . 
p06-069-s05-00 === Sandra 
p06-069-s05-01 === said instinctively : 
p06-069-s06-00 === ' I told him 
p06-069-s06-01 === I knew he was responsible for 
p06-069-s06-02 === Beryl's death . ' 
p06-088-s00-00 === Her eyes darkened in torment . 
p06-088-s01-00 === ' Are 
p06-088-s01-01 === you sure that she was telling the truth ? ' 
p06-088-s02-00 === ' Good heavens , darling , why on earth 
p06-088-s02-01 === should she lie ? 
p06-088-s03-00 === Besides , it wasn't just 
p06-088-s03-01 === her word . 
p06-088-s04-00 === There was enough evidence , 
p06-088-s04-01 === no matter how one might want to 
p06-088-s04-02 === disbelieve the facts . ' E
p06-088-s05-00 === lation 
p06-088-s05-01 === touched him after the cold wind 
p06-088-s05-02 === of suspense . 
p06-088-s06-00 === ' It will be interesting 
p06-088-s06-01 === to see what comes out at the inquest
p06-096-s00-00 ===  . What his story will be . 
p06-096-s01-00 === I reckon 
p06-096-s01-01 === he 'll confine himself to the nervous 
p06-096-s01-02 === origin of her recent illness . 
p06-096-s02-00 === His notes 
p06-096-s02-01 === will be truthful , but what he leaves out 
p06-096-s02-02 === will matter most . ' 
p06-096-s03-00 === Strange how just 
p06-096-s03-01 === then Philip was so certain that Nicholas 
p06-096-s03-02 === would never betray him . 
p06-096-s04-00 === He loved 
p06-096-s04-01 === Sandra too deeply to ruin her 
p06-096-s04-02 === future happiness . 
p06-096-s05-00 === Had ever circum- 
p06-096-s05-01 === stances conspired so cunningly ? 
p06-096-s06-00 === Philip's spirits soared . 
p06-104-s00-00 === He was better ; he had made a 
p06-104-s00-01 === miraculous recovery and Sandra would 
p06-104-s00-02 === soon be his wife . 
p06-104-s01-00 === The Devil , he thought , 
p06-104-s01-01 === certainly looked after his own . 
p06-104-s02-00 === Something in Sandra's attitude struck 
p06-104-s02-01 === him suddenly , making him say : 
p06-104-s03-00 === ' You can't forgive him for this - 
p06-104-s03-01 === can you ? ' ' 
p06-104-s04-00 === Forgive is an unctuous , 
p06-104-s04-01 === patronizing word , ' she replied . 
p06-104-s05-00 === ' I despise 
p06-104-s05-01 === the deceit . T
p06-104-s06-00 === he lies . ' 
p06-242-s00-00 === Philip bristled . 
p06-242-s01-00 === ' It was never our intention 
p06-242-s01-01 === to have one of those carnival affairs , ' he 
p06-242-s01-02 === retorted and in that second , he became the man of 
p06-242-s01-03 === success exerting authority . 
p06-242-s02-00 === Sandra watched her father's 
p06-242-s02-01 === face pale . 
p06-242-s03-00 === Philip , she knew , got on his nerves , but 
p06-242-s03-01 === everything had gone over her head . 
p06-242-s04-00 === It didn't really 
p06-242-s04-01 === matter what was being said because she was 
p06-242-s04-02 === no longer a part of it . 
p06-248-s00-00 === The thought of Nicholas haunted her , the sense of 
p06-248-s00-01 === loss crucifying . 
p06-248-s01-00 === Her father's comment roused her as 
p06-248-s01-01 === he said , 
p06-248-s02-00 === ' I was not talking of a carnival . 
p06-248-s03-00 === But I 
p06-248-s03-01 === presume we shall be allowed to have one or two 
p06-248-s03-02 === of our friends at the ceremony . ' 
r03-053-s00-00 === His voice was like his black and pin-stripe , 
r03-053-s00-01 === a grey superimposition of respectability over 
r03-053-s00-02 === the original colour of his own natural vowels , 
r03-053-s00-03 === the result being somehow as ineffective , not 
r03-053-s00-04 === just dusty-grey but muddy , slimy even . 
r03-053-s01-00 === His digressions too , seemed to have no other 
r03-053-s01-01 === purpose than the throwing of dust in his 
r03-053-s01-02 === client's eyes , the dust of fake security , of 
r06-000-s00-00 === Vence is a sober spot , half way between small 
r06-000-s00-01 === town and village , pigeon grey , sly with arches , and 
r06-000-s00-02 === linked by a whispering plot of fountains . 
r06-000-s01-00 === In the main 
r06-000-s01-01 === tree-heavy square you can sit in the autumn 
r06-000-s01-02 === sunshine , still burning like a half-cooled iron , 
r06-000-s01-03 === sip pastis and read the local newspapers .
r06-003-s00-00 === One called La Patriote is Communist , and at the time 
r06-003-s00-01 === of our arrival it was throwing huge over-ripe verbal 
r06-003-s00-02 === tomatoes at General de Gaulle . 
r06-003-s01-00 === One side of this square 
r06-003-s01-01 === is a smart but modest bar called Pierre's Bar . 
r06-003-s02-00 === For one 
r06-003-s02-01 === day , with the help of the Syndicat d'Initiative , we had been 
r06-003-s02-02 === hunting for furnished rooms , and had given up , when an 
r06-003-s02-03 === elderly lady , the owner of a residence called the Poet's Nest , 
r06-003-s02-04 === had firmly closed the door in our noses . 
r06-007-s00-00 === ' It is a pity , ' said Mart , ' because it would have been 
r06-007-s00-01 === a good address . ' 
r06-007-s01-00 === Now , after a woman's radar look , 
r06-007-s01-01 === she decided Pierre would solve our problems . 
r06-007-s02-00 === This 
r06-007-s02-01 === was true , Pierre was a true Provenc*?6al , thin and 
r06-007-s02-02 === yellow as lemon peel , wrestling with some gnawing rat 
r06-007-s02-03 === of an illness , man of all trades , married to a commanding 
r06-007-s02-04 === lady who loved small talk and the discreet 
r06-007-s02-05 === accumulation of money . 
r06-011-s00-00 === We went in . 
r06-011-s01-00 === There were a few people in the bar , 
r06-011-s01-01 === elderly , well-off , artistic , who , you felt , had made a hard 
r06-011-s01-02 === bargain for giving up . 
r06-011-s02-00 === ' I have furnished rooms , ' said 
r06-011-s02-01 === Pierre , ' and all mod cons . ' 
r06-011-s03-00 === The price was 16,000 francs a 
r06-011-s03-01 === month . 
r06-011-s04-00 === ' Yes , ' we said immediately , even before viewing . 
r06-011-s05-00 === We were shown around by Pierre . 
r06-018-s00-00 === The flat was on the third floor ; two rooms ; soft Provenc*? 
r06-018-s00-01 === 6al view ; good intimate furnishing and colour ; running 
r06-018-s00-02 === hot water from Butagas installation for washing-up , 
r06-018-s00-03 === basin and bidet ; own private , modern lavatory . 
r06-018-s01-00 === The 
r06-018-s01-01 === first night's sleeping was like a long convalescence . 
r06-018-s02-00 === We were woken up twice about dawn by a soft 
r06-018-s02-01 === eruption of turtle-doves . 
r06-022-s00-00 === This was strange , even magic , because the owner's 
r06-022-s00-01 === name was Pierre Tortorolo which , in Nicoison Italian means 
r06-022-s00-02 === ' turtledove ' . 
r06-022-s01-00 === Pierre Turtledove . 
r06-022-s02-00 === When we woke up properly it 
r06-022-s02-01 === was raining , an even hopeless rain than London , and we 
r06-022-s02-02 === looked out of the windows at the weeping trees and the 
r06-022-s02-03 === curling white breath of the mountains . 
r06-022-s03-00 === The land looked 
r06-022-s03-01 === like a beaten woman and the turtle-doves cried her 
r06-022-s03-02 === shame . 
r06-027-s00-00 === There they were , in fact , below us , eight of them . 
r06-027-s01-00 === Four of them were flattened on the window sills , two 
r06-027-s01-01 === immolated on a nearby roof top , the other pair copulating . 
r06-027-s02-00 === We had a morning at Pierre's . 
r06-027-s03-00 === He talked about people . 
r06-027-s04-00 === Marc Chagall used to live here and an Englishman named 
r06-027-s04-01 === Lawrence . 
r06-027-s05-00 === He was here , near the railway station , three or 
r06-027-s05-01 === four years . 
r06-027-s06-00 === During this period he wrote a book , 
r06-027-s06-01 === The Lover of Lady Chatterly . 
r06-035-s00-00 === No , he hadn't read it ; Madame did all the 
r06-035-s00-01 === reading . 
r06-035-s01-00 === Lawrence died in this very place . 
r06-035-s02-00 === He used to come to Pierre's Bar again and 
r06-035-s02-01 === again . 
r06-035-s03-00 === No , he couldn't really remember 
r06-035-s03-01 === him , he was one of the crowd . 
r06-035-s04-00 === The 
r06-035-s04-01 === sun came out ; Mart went shopping ; I 
r06-035-s04-02 === sat in the square reading the Patriote . 
r06-041-s00-00 === There was a front-page rear-attack on de 
r06-041-s00-01 === Gaulle , and the rest of the paper was given up to 
r06-041-s00-02 === murders , apart for an outcry against a 
r06-041-s00-03 === proposal to drop radio-active material into 
r06-041-s00-04 === the Mediterranean between Corsica and St 
r06-041-s00-05 === Raphael . 
r06-041-s01-00 === All the murders were well documented 
r06-041-s01-01 === and had the air of being written by an 
r06-041-s01-02 === ingenious , but mad film director of the 
r06-041-s01-03 === Thirties . 
r06-044-s00-00 === They mostly occurred in lonely farm-houses . 
r06-044-s01-00 === Monsieur H , for instance , had been clubbed and 
r06-044-s01-01 === throttled to death by his wife , children and 
r06-044-s01-02 === father-in-law , after muddling up some sheep 
r06-044-s01-03 === while the worse for drink . 
r06-044-s02-00 === The family 
r06-044-s02-01 === group then sat down for a late lunch 
r06-044-s02-02 === before the father-in-law telephoned the police . 
r06-044-s03-00 === Then again , Monsieur V , owing to family 
r06-044-s03-01 === troubles , had written to the local 
r06-044-s03-02 === paper and the superintendent of police , 
r06-044-s03-03 === informing them that he was on the point 
r06-049-s00-00 === Monsieur V's house was immediately 
r06-049-s00-01 === surrounded by firemen and other officials , 
r06-049-s00-02 === but there was no Monsieur V. 
r06-049-s01-00 === He telephoned 
r06-049-s01-01 === a few minutes later from a nearby village , 
r06-049-s01-02 === apologising for the trouble , but explaining 
r06-049-s01-03 === that the walls were porous and the 
r06-049-s01-04 === gas had escaped . 
r06-049-s02-00 === General relief was 
r06-049-s02-01 === expressed , but Monsieur V ( this was 
r06-049-s02-02 === actually reported in the next issue ) returned 
r06-049-s02-03 === home and shot himself , leaving a note 
r06-049-s02-04 === which again left his household goods 
r06-053-s00-00 === Some grim comic relief was provided by 
r06-053-s00-01 === an elderly farm labourer out for a shoot 
r06-053-s00-02 === who hid himself in a bush and imitated 
r06-053-s00-03 === a blackbird . 
r06-053-s01-00 === Unfortunately a sporting taxi-driver 
r06-053-s01-01 === was after this very bird and shot the farm- 
r06-053-s01-02 === labourer in the face . 
r06-053-s02-00 === All , however , 
r06-053-s02-01 === ended well , reported the paper , since the 
r06-053-s02-02 === pellets were easily removed and the 
r06-053-s02-03 === labourer was able to return to work the 
r06-053-s02-04 === same afternoon . 
r06-057-s00-00 === We travelled down to Nice on the Lambretta . 
r06-057-s01-00 === You can free-wheel down a quarter of the 
r06-057-s01-01 === way . 
r06-057-s02-00 === In the middle of the journey is a 
r06-057-s02-01 === valley with a sea of vines and olives 
r06-057-s02-02 === and beaches of earth pricked to blood by 
r06-057-s02-03 === the hoe . 
r06-057-s03-00 === Rising from the flecked sea are 
r06-057-s03-01 === islands tapering to shipwrecked castles and 
r06-057-s03-02 === towns , grey , rose-headed mariners clinging 
r06-057-s03-03 === like limpets to the rock . 
r06-062-s00-00 === There is a curd of morning smoke and 
r06-062-s00-01 === a muffled bell taps the sky . 
r06-062-s01-00 === Here we 
r06-062-s01-01 === stopped , as in fine weather we always 
r06-062-s01-02 === stopped . 
r06-062-s02-00 === Down below is the village of 
r06-062-s02-01 === Cagnes , but between are pockets of 
r06-062-s02-02 === heat and cold like the hands of 
r06-062-s02-03 === friends or strangers , and a flurry of 
r06-062-s02-04 === early smells , the dark bosoms of 
r06-062-s02-05 === beech and the thin pine fingers 
r06-062-s02-06 === kissed by the sun . 
r06-066-s00-00 === Then here was Nice , and the old holiday 
r06-066-s00-01 === sea , blue as a new school exercise 
r06-066-s00-02 === book . 
r06-066-s01-00 === The same old Nice , creamy , 
r06-066-s01-01 === vulgar , out of time , bitter-sweet with 
r06-066-s01-02 === the ghosts of dead monarchs and brilliant 
r06-066-s01-03 === prostitutes , edging past grubby grandeur 
r06-066-s01-04 === to the old sleeping port . 
r06-066-s02-00 === This , and 
r06-066-s02-01 === Paris , were my ruined pavilions , and I 
r06-066-s02-02 === could catch the taste of dead dreams on 
r06-066-s02-03 === my tongue like spray . 
r06-070-s00-00 === We parked the Lambretta opposite the 
r06-070-s00-01 === Negresco , and went to the beach to 
r06-070-s00-02 === have a swim . 
r06-070-s01-00 === Amazing bedlam rocked 
r06-070-s01-01 === in our eyes . 
r06-070-s02-00 === The sea boiled with waves , 
r06-070-s02-01 === they galloped to the walls and spumed 
r06-070-s02-02 === over the Promenade des Anglais . 
r06-070-s03-00 === A huge 
r06-070-s03-01 === crowd had collected . 
r06-070-s04-00 === There were firemen 
r06-070-s04-01 === and policemen and ambulances , and the 
r06-070-s04-02 === eyes of the spectators were hard with 
r06-070-s04-03 === disaster . 
r06-076-s00-00 === They all had that neat look of 
r06-076-s00-01 === Mediterranean people to whom nothing 
r06-076-s00-02 === could ever happen , the chosen sane , the 
r06-076-s00-03 === uncuckolded , unrobbed , sheltered from 
r06-076-s00-04 === disease and accident by doctors , God and 
r06-076-s00-05 === the municipality . 
r06-076-s01-00 === Yet , at any time now , 
r06-076-s01-01 === the bell would ring for them - the gilded 
r06-076-s01-02 === love house , the mad grandmother or the 
r06-076-s01-03 === bloody child at the crossroads . 
r06-090-s00-00 === It was growing cold . 
r06-090-s01-00 === We left the 
r06-090-s01-01 === crowd and drove back to Vence . 
r06-090-s02-00 === The cool evening perfumes stood 
r06-090-s02-01 === beckoning at the corners of the roads . 
r06-090-s03-00 === Mart is unable to smell ( her sense 
r06-090-s03-01 === organs were impaired years ago ) , and 
r06-090-s03-02 === I had to explain the low , sharp and 
r06-090-s03-03 === sweet signals in the air . 
r06-090-s04-00 === When we 
r06-090-s04-01 === got back home we felt exhausted . 
r06-090-s05-00 === London sickness ( a sense of guilt , 
r06-090-s05-01 === mingled with the memory of sandwiches 
r06-097-s00-00 === We went straight to bed and slept until 
r06-097-s00-01 === the turtle-doves drummed up the 
r06-097-s00-02 === sun . 
r06-097-s01-00 === The next morning , in the square 
r06-097-s01-01 === opposite Pierre's , I read about the Nice 
r06-097-s01-02 === beach catastrophe in the Patriote . 
r06-097-s02-00 === Mart had been right , the body had been 
r06-097-s02-01 === a woman's . 
r06-097-s03-00 === It belonged to a Madame
r06-097-s03-01 === N. 
r06-097-s04-00 === Enquiries had been made in the 
r06-097-s04-01 === neighbourhood , and it transpired that 
r06-097-s04-02 === Madame N's husband had made an 
r06-097-s04-03 === arrangement with the dead lady's sister 
r06-103-s00-00 === The sister , able to swim , had returned 
r06-103-s00-01 === to the shore , but instead of returning 
r06-103-s00-02 === to her brother-in-law ( with whom 
r06-103-s00-03 === she had an illicit relationship ) , she 
r06-103-s00-04 === went to her fiance*?2's house and 
r06-103-s00-05 === confessed everything . 
r06-103-s01-00 === Her fiance*?2 
r06-103-s01-01 === reported her to the police , and then jumped 
r06-103-s01-02 === off a cliff near Monte Carlo . 
r06-106-s00-00 === The day I promised to take Catherine 
r06-106-s00-01 === down to visit my young friend Philip 
r06-106-s00-02 === at his school in the country , we were 
r06-106-s00-03 === to leave at eleven , but she arrived 
r06-106-s00-04 === at nine . 
r06-106-s01-00 === Her blue dress was new , 
r06-106-s01-01 === and so were her fashionable shoes . 
r06-106-s02-00 === Her 
r06-106-s02-01 === hair had just been done . 
r06-106-s03-00 === She looked 
r06-106-s03-01 === more than ever like a pink and gold 
r06-106-s03-02 === Renoir girl who expects everything from 
r06-106-s03-03 === life . 
r06-111-s00-00 === Catherine lives in a white house 
r06-111-s00-01 === overlooking the sweeping brown tides 
r06-111-s00-02 === of the river . 
r06-111-s01-00 === She helped me clean up my 
r06-111-s01-01 === flat with a devotion which said that 
r06-111-s01-02 === she felt small flats were altogether more 
r06-111-s01-03 === romantic than large houses . 
r06-111-s02-00 === We drank 
r06-111-s02-01 === tea , and talked mainly about Philip , who , 
r06-111-s02-02 === being 15 , has pure stern tastes in every- 
r06-111-s02-03 === thing from food to music . 
r06-115-s00-00 === Catherine looked at the books lying 
r06-115-s00-01 === around his room , and asked if she 
r06-115-s00-02 === might borrow the stories of Isaac Babel 
r06-115-s00-03 === to read on the train . 
r06-115-s01-00 === Catherine is 13 . 
r06-115-s02-00 === I suggested she might find them dif- 
r06-115-s02-01 === ficult , but she said , 
r06-115-s03-00 === ' Philip reads them , 
r06-115-s03-01 === doesn't he ? ' D
r06-115-s04-00 === uring the journey I read 
r06-115-s04-01 === newspapers and watched her pretty 
r06-115-s04-02 === frowning face as she turned the 
r06-115-s04-03 === pages of Babel , for she was determined 
r06-115-s04-04 === to let nothing get between her and 
r06-121-s00-00 === At the school , which is charming , ci- 
r06-121-s00-01 === vilised and expensive , the two children 
r06-121-s00-02 === walked together across green fields , and 
r06-121-s00-03 === I followed , seeing how the sun gilded 
r06-121-s00-04 === their bright friendly heads turned 
r06-121-s00-05 === towards each other as they talked . 
r06-121-s01-00 === In 
r06-121-s01-01 === Catherine's left hand she carried the 
r06-121-s01-02 === stories of Isaac Babel . 
r06-121-s02-00 === After lunch we 
r06-121-s02-01 === went to the pictures . 
r06-121-s03-00 === Philip allowed 
r06-121-s03-01 === # it to be seen that he thought going to 
r06-121-s03-02 === the pictures just for the fun of it was 
r06-126-s00-00 === For his sake we chose the more 
r06-126-s00-01 === serious of the two films that were 
r06-126-s00-02 === showing in the little town . 
r06-126-s01-00 === It was 
r06-126-s01-01 === about a good priest who helped cri- 
r06-126-s01-02 === minals in New York . 
r06-126-s02-00 === His goodness , how- 
r06-126-s02-01 === ever , was not enough to prevent one 
r06-126-s02-02 === of them from being sent to the gas 
r06-126-s02-03 === chamber ; and Philip and I waited with 
r06-126-s02-04 === Catherine in the dark until she had stopped 
r06-126-s02-05 === crying and could face the light of a golden 
r06-126-s02-06 === evening . 
r06-130-s00-00 === At the entrance of the cinema the 
r06-130-s00-01 === doorman was lying in wait for anyone 
r06-130-s00-02 === who had red eyes . 
r06-130-s01-00 === Grasping Catherine 
r06-130-s01-01 === by her suffering arm , he said bitterly : 
r06-130-s02-00 === ' Yes , why are you crying , he had to be 
r06-130-s02-01 === punished for his crime , didn't he ? ' 
r06-130-s03-00 === Cathe- 
r06-130-s03-01 === rine stared at him , incredulous . 
r06-130-s04-00 === Philip 
r06-130-s04-01 === rescued her by saying with disdain : 
r06-130-s05-00 === ' Some people don't know right from wrong 
r06-130-s05-01 === even when its demonstrated to them . ' 
r06-137-s00-00 === The doorman turned his attention 
r06-137-s00-01 === to the next red-eyed emerger from the 
r06-137-s00-02 === dark ; and we went on together to 
r06-137-s00-03 === the station , the children silent because 
r06-137-s00-04 === of the cruelty of the world . 
r06-137-s01-00 === Finally Catherine 
r06-137-s01-01 === said , her eyes wet again : 
r06-137-s02-00 === ' I think its all 
r06-137-s02-01 === absolutely beastly , and I can't bear to think 
r06-137-s02-02 === about it . ' 
r06-137-s03-00 === And Philip said : 
r06-137-s04-00 === ' But we 've got 
r06-137-s04-01 === to think about it , don't you see , because 
r06-137-s04-02 === if we don't it 'll just go on and on , don't 
r06-137-s04-03 === you see ? ' 
r06-143-s00-00 === In the train going back to London I sat 
r06-143-s00-01 === beside # Catherine . 
r06-143-s01-00 === She had the stories open 
r06-143-s01-01 === in front of her , but she said : 
r06-143-s02-00 === ' Philip 's awfully lucky . 
r06-143-s03-00 === I wish I went to that school . 
r06-143-s04-00 === Did you notice 
r06-143-s04-01 === that girl who said hullo to him in the garden ?
